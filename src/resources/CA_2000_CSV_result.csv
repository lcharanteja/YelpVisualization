_2E7DVE_tLxjhDHyZdRIug,309Zu1LghT1-XewnjrzBnA,3,4,9/9/2012,I consumed too much Mountain Dew here and shat my pants a few steps out the door after wrongfully mistaken diarrhea spray for a fart. As I ran to the bathroom and stripped myself of my soiled skinny jeans  I looked down and to my surprise  my shit looked like pure Mountain Dew. I'm not going to point any fingers here and accuse any kind of foul play  but it was a bit too coincidental for my liking. That being said  this place is great and I'd highly recommended their vegan pizza to any idiots like myself that don't be animal. I look forward to returning here again  but next time I'll be fully prepared with any extra set of trousers.,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
_2E7DVE_tLxjhDHyZdRIug,T1ggsBzQ5FJQMA59G9Jgsg,1,5,6/29/2012,I tried Zpizza for take-out last night. I'm not a big pizza fan but was having a casual dinner with my husband and another couple  and so decided to try it. The pizza was very  very good! We had ham and pineapple  which I didn't try  but which was completely gone by the end of the meal. We also had sausage and mushroom--only 1 piece left  and I got a wheat crust  basil pesto sauce  chicken sausage with vegetables. It was terrific! I will definitely be back. It reminds me of when I first tried Chipotle for mexican food--the difference was notable and I could feel good about patronizing them. Now I have a place for high quality pizza that is reasonable priced. Thank you Zpizza!,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
_2E7DVE_tLxjhDHyZdRIug,r-Ql-Mjf6qS8_q4ci1udMA,1,3,5/25/2012,I originally went to Zpizza because my dining companion was looking for somewhere that made gluten-free pizza; this was the spot. The gluten-free crust was really good: we got the pizza with artichoke hearts  garlic  and a few other topics: flavorful and fresh.   On another visit  I tried a slice of the veggie pizza  which was equally good. All in all  not the most filling slices in the world but fresh ingredients and friendly staff keep me coming back.,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1
_2E7DVE_tLxjhDHyZdRIug,oA-2YR__3OhNM0Hd2dz21A,1,4,4/13/2012,We ordered the gluten free California version with chicken sausage. I was  hesitant since the California is all veggies  hence the side of chicken sausage.  My five year old son loved it and is on his third piece as I type. The crust is  very thin and crisp  almost cracker like consistency. Although I liked a charred  crust  it made it hard for my son to eat  especially as he's missing two  incisors. The taste was great  though  fresh yet the veggie flavors melded well  together. I found it cheaper to order a large gluten free pizza and freeze the  extras vs. buying frozen gluten free pizza from the grocery store. This will be  a regular eatery for us.,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0

_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA,zIq0Rec9-EYoKznTYswZuw,2,4,12/15/2010,4 stars for the only thing I've ever ordered and will always order:  The Rachel!  Pastrami  swiss cheese  coleslaw  1000 island dressing  on grilled rye bread. For ~$9  you get a pretty filling sandwich + chips (or fries).  It's really good... the pastrami is not lean at all  sometimes a little bit chewy but whatever  it's still yumm.  I tried the sweet potato fries - they were ok  but a little too soggy for take-out.  Their menu is kind of overwhelming  so I don't think I will venture far from my tried and true.  But trust - the Rachel is hella good!  Service has always been really nice.  Overall  I recommend stopping by if you're in the neighborhood.  Tip: Sign up for their frequent buyer card... you save some change every time you order and can buy a pint of their house brew for real cheap (like $2? I think).  That reminds me  you can't drink beer at the tables outside the restaurant =(,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA,oKonm6MkUQ8vJ8sUIVlyVg,3,2,9/13/2012,More like 2.5 stars.  I dislike the clusterfuck of toppings on the dogs  burgers and sandwiches.  A cut above many of the other shitty similar places like Pink's  Marty's  and Jeff's  but there is definitely something missing here.  If you order something simple like a hotdog with mustard and onions and some fries  you are not going to be disappointed.  A cold 22oz beer in a plastic cup is available on tap and there are some specials on Monday or game day or something.  Food in Westwood  with the exception of some wonderful Persian places  is not particularly noteworthy.  The Stand  therefore  is right at home here.,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0
_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA,Za35VFCB9QhTgb0Pl13oWg,2,4,8/18/2011,If you want really good service  this is the place to go. Yes  the food is good  but the whole appeal of this place for me is that I know I will leave satisfied. One time I came here with a friend and ordered something I didn't end up particularly liking. One of the staff members told me that they'd be more than happy to change it for another menu item for me at no charge. I thought that was really awesome  and I ended up loving the chicken sandwich I traded it for.   They have great hot dogs and burgers  and great deals if you have a Stand Card  which is free :) I also love the location  nearby a lot of cool little shops  etc.   I will definitely be back when I'm in the area :),0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA,#NAME?,1,3,5/15/2011,I got the Philly Cheese Steak with a large order of sweet potato fries for about $14.  I was disappointed that they were out of their draft root beer which I've heard good things about.  It wasn't the best sandwich I ever had but it wasn't bad.  The fries were pretty good.  I think it would be a good idea to stick to their hot dogs which I hope to try next time!,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA,R64tASLbS4_ZKntGLrEBYw,4,4,6/23/2012,Tried The Stand with some co-workers the other day  and was really happy with what I got.  I kind of don''t see the point in paying $5 for a hot dog  and most reviewers didn't seem the like the hot dogs here anyways.  But there was a cilantro lime chicken sandwich on the special menu  and it totally sounded worth getting.    Our food came out quickly  and was very nice.  My sandwich had grilled chicken with red onion  avocado  a creamy cilantro dressing that wasn't too strong on a warmed bun.  Delicious!!!  Instead of fries  I got the homemade potato chips  and they were quite good.  They serve homemade pickle slices that I should have tried  because apparently they are quite good.  But I definitely liked the self-service drinks & the TVs that were playing Golf Channel  so I will be back for sure!,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1
_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA,vpTKQM8m3N8cQi0POE0EDQ,1,5,12/2/2011,Amazing food and even better customer service.  The draft root beer and the fire fries are definite must haves.  I love this place and on a Monday  the deals are kickin.  Come here at least once a week.  I brought my dog once and I had to eat outside  they accidently served me a beer (which you can't have outside) they comped me a root beer and told me they'd get me back next time.  Always amazes me how friendly they are here.  Very progressive as well.  The fact that on a Monday  I was able to get a beer  loaded dog and special fries for under 8 bucks  makes me smile.  In tough times  nothing beats the stand.  Hands down.  Also recommend the chili.,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1
_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA,ieHlLVlT4RjKPabWfMAwRA,1,4,9/6/2012,"It was first weekend free museums courtesy of Bank of America  so my husband and I decided to head over to the Westside to visit the Hammer -- a place neither of us had been to.  We were going to go early afternoon  but on the ride over  we started to realize we hadn't eaten anything since early yesterday  and it was time to fix our blood sugar levels.  That's when I uttered under my breath  Oh  I wish there was a place like The Stand [in Encino]  because i can really just use a good hot dog and some fries.  And some pickles.""  Hmmm  maybe we should just Yelp?  So  we parked at the Hammer and proceeded to see what Yelp would take us.  And  just like it was the hand of God  fate presented us Westwood's The Stand  literally a block away.  I could not believe it.  Thinking it was too good to be true  on the walk over  I was half expecting the place to be closed for the weekend  or anything but open  but not only was it open  it was just the beginning of the lunch rush  so we got there at a perfect time.  We both shared a chili dog  a brat  and some fries.  YU-UUUUMMMM.  It was really all we needed  and the price was just what we needed  too.  And  the exhibit at the Hammer was tremendous  I'm glad we caught it while it was still open.  Altogether  it was a great day to hang out in Westwood.  I highly recommend!  Now  Tha Stand... you just gotta move closer to Burbank...... okay????""",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0

_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA,FaVZNH16KEYdiBdjh8B2pg,1,5,3/17/2012,First  I'll admit  this place is not really 5 stars  but I don't think it deserves the 3 stars it currently has on yelp  so my rating is a bit inflated. The family and I were stuck on Westwood on a Friday afternoon. If you know anything about LA  it is that freeways are toxic at this time of the day. So we decided to just hang out around the area and find dinner. A quick glance through yelp shows that this area is pretty weak as far as food goes. There was the typical fast food joint that we try to avoid  and there were some high end eateries but all in all nothing that really jumped out. Then we saw this place and found it only has three starts  but we figured how can you go wrong with burgrers   so we gave it a try. It did not disappoint. Aside from the great service that we go  I thought my burgers was great. I added chipoptle to it and was not too overpowering and all. The wife had a chicken burger with onion and avocado and was also great. It wasn't like the best burger and it was a bit on the expensive side but considering the location I'd said it was worth a visit. Then again maybe UCLA students just have high standard for food and that would explain all the bad reviews around Westwood  I guess I'll never know,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1
_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA,Lfbfjl7kxJIxLBRBzxNOPA,2,4,4/30/2012,The stand honestly isn't deserving of a 3 star rating as mentioned by another yelper.  I honestly think it's more of a 4 star establishment. It would seem that this restaurant is yet again another victim of yelp bullies. Their food is tons better than fast food and way cheaper than all the other sit down restaurants in westwood.   What I got Cilantro lime chicken sandwich: this sandwich was really good and what really made it was that freakin sauce!!! it was PHENOMENAL. like seriously crack to me!!     Sure it was more expensive than the other chicken sandwiches  but hey I wanted something with FLAVOR! if I wanted something on the plain side  then I would've chosen their regular chicken sandwich.  But why would I do that?? It would be plain and it's not like  I could complain. I ordered it lol.  Obviously if you don't want something plain then you should order something that has more oomph.,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0
_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA,ghvUFa0oPTGJW-ZnNuDASA,1,3,2/21/2011,"The food here is generally good. The service is a bit spotty though. I had the brat dog (if that is indeed the name)... bratwurst with sauerkraut. I had it come with chips and a root-beer float. There were two cashiers serving us. The one who served me left afterward and one guy stayed. The latter guy was kind of annoying.  The dogs took a bit long to come out but my friend's dog came incorrectly (i.e. split and without the veggies she asked for). We waited about 10-15 min for her dog though there was only one other ordering customer. Mine came out 5 min after. The guy came back 5 min later after giving mine with a smile on his face... obviously to hit on my friend. OH! Did I get your order wrong..."" Blah blah. My friend said it was fine and he said he'd bring another one even though she would eat what she had as she was pressed for time. All this time I still hadn't gotten my root beer float. (And Tina MAD  Tina SMASH when thirsty!) While he was asking her about the dog  giving all those cheesy smiles. Blech. I said I also hadn't gotten my root-beer float yet and he shot an ugly glance at me. Gee thanks  asshole! I just want what I paid for! Sorry to rain on your parade but your job should come first. Because of that this review is -1 star.   I haven't had the burger yet but I'll try it sometime... hopefully that same guy won't be there. The food generally seems pretty good... the only thing that seemed kinda expensive were the shake and root-beer float (~$4 and ~$3.50 respectively... to put that in perspective the sausage/dog meal/sandwich was less than $5).""",0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0
_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA,N56ozwQSTQAoRrNppUbtrA,1,4,5/14/2010,"Probably one of the better places that we've stumbled upon around Westwood Village.  It could be a little bit pricey if you tend to have a bigger appetite like me  (from running/biking/swimming all the time...) but a tasty meal.  We opted for sweet potato fries instead of their chips too which added $1.50 per meal.  Total for a burger and hot dog for me  and a veggie burger for my wife  one soda  and a $5 off coupon in the entertainment book and it still came out to almost $30.    If you want to save a little  sign up for their Stand"" card.. You get 5% off.  They also have a deal on Mondays where their regular hot dogs are $1  and their special ones are like $2.50.

For real. Their specials are really good  too.  I took my bf here not too long ago and they had a burger with goat cheese and arugula - he got beef and I got a veggie one - they were awesome too.  Their fries are also really good - sweet potato fries are amazing! I've been wanting to try a cobbler  it's one of my favorite foods of all time.  But I haven't gotten around to it.  Let you know whenever I get here again  because I will definitely be getting it next time! And I haven't had the milkshakes myself  but a couple of my friends got them once when we all went to The Stand together  and they looked REALLY good.

_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA,r5kMmPM0Lu3nOjFP46VizQ,1,4,3/21/2012,Great burgers  great chicken sandwiches  great beverages  a great location  and great fries!  Every time I've gone to The Stand  I've left needing a bed and a nap.  The customer service is good  you just walk up  place your order  get  a number  and sit down.  Then the server brings over your food.  The burgers are cooked to order and you can get a nice medium rawr burger if that's what you're feeling!  You can also get delicious fries  but their sweet potato fries are reallllllllly good.  I also like their cole slaw  and their chicken sandwich has hit the spot when I've been eating lighter.  So why  why did it only get 4 stars when this is a 5 star review?  I've been there 5 or 6 times and only once did they actually have the root beer on tap!  I want that root beer  the one time I had it my mouth was engorged in amazing flavor ecstasy  and to have it taken away from me more than once after that was enough to make me drop a star.  I don't know what they need to do  but they need to have that root beer to compliment those amazing burgers!  As soon as the sign for draft root beer catches your eye  it's really all you want  and I just felt it a cop out to not be able to get it all the time.  But even though my lust for root beer hasn't been satiated  the hunger has been and I can sleep at night knowing that The Stand makes awesome food!

There's a lot to choose from and unlike many similar places  you can customize your sandwich or burger to get exactly what you want. I had the Patty Melt  which was delicious  and not too greasy. The bread was crispy and the burger was done just right. The fries are thick home style. I also had a salad which was fresh and really good.   I liked the food and the ambiance far better than the delis in the area. It feels young and hip  exactly the kind of place a college neighborhood should have.

_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA,BVffQtwOInGXn-ONvYxksw,1,2,5/20/2010,"When deciding to have a burger  there are certain caveats that go through my  mind  chief among them:  Man  this is a lot of calories  so this better be good.  I've had Umami burger quite a few times  Comme ca a few times  Pie n Burger. Those are my LA faves.   But i'm not a snob in this regard as I frankly love Big Macs when the mood strikes. Just make it tasty.  I can't put it more plainly:  The Stand has one of the most bland and tasteless burgers I think I've ever had outside a school cafeteria.   But don't associate it with cafeterias: the burger looks edible. It has its own sauce  cheese (not american  which is their first mistake)  what appears to be fresh chuck  and grilled onions (my preference is raw  but I don't mind either).  What is missing is seasoning. If there is any  it completely missed the meat. I literally ate half the burger. My interest in the whole thing shut down after about the 3rd bite.  The fries are equally bland  and a bit too largely cut for my taste.  What elevates this to a two star and not a one star is the Big Red Chili Dog. The taste of the dog is spicy and has a nice pop. The chili is meh  ok"" and the bun almost certainly is store bought.  But it's not a bad hot dog. I'd have it again  if I ever had to revisit this restaurant.  But it doesn't save the damage done from the burger. I would say it's a bad thing if I leave your restaurant regretting eating the burger  because now I'm still hankering for a burger  instead of being satisfied with the Stand.  Such is life  I suppose. If you eat here  enjoy the hot dogs. But you'll be unsatisfied with the burger.""",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

There's ample parking (2 hours free) at the parking lot  just a few steps away. Service was exceptional and we were looked after by the hostess  our waiter and store manager.   The order; Bob's original combo  kid's chicken fingers and patty melt combo. All burger's are made to your liking. The patty melt that my husband ordered looked tasty and will be my next choice on our next visit. The onion rings were really tasty too  with a nice seasoned batter and crisp rings. My son loved their fries  which were cooled slightly in comparison to mine  most likely to avoid any burns. I noticed and I appreciate the thought.

And legend has it that one of my uncles once showed up to a birthday party of mine with a full size Bob's big boy as a gift for me (allegedly).   I've wanted to check out this local (Pasadena) Bob's big boy for some time and since I installed the groupon app and saw they had a $6 for $12 deal I thought the timing was right. A meal for $6 is hard to beat.   I order a meal that came with what was a cheeseburger  fries and salad. I also got a drink and it brought my total to just under $12.   I got the food and the first thing that stood out where how small the fries and salad portions where. I think I might be better if they just did one side but did more of it.   The second thing that stood out was the burger; it reminded me of a big mac with the third piece of bread in the middle.   I dug in and the burger was fine  not great not bad  the fries where good  and the salad was ok. I ordered with salad with blue cheese and although the salad seemed drenched in dressing I couldn't taste the blue cheese.   It's hard to complain when you get dinner for $6 but the meal didn't really stand out. And if I had paid full price I think might have been more upset. If you haven't been its worth checking out but see if they have a groupon deal.,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0
_GTu9MAHtHMkpIUbGSMsdg,iRGk2XzqvotdOUTtoITIsA,5,3,5/8/2010,I can't remember what the old Bob's Big Boy restaurants were like even though my parents dragged my screaming child self to them fairly frequently. This newest incarnation serves simple food with no frills and does it quite well.   Food: I scarfed down my classic hamburger which was drizzled in creamy  tangy sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_GTu9MAHtHMkpIUbGSMsdg?select=Ib7Q6Q5mhrgwHL65MvgjwQ). The meat was tender and was sandwiched between two slices of cheese and a assortment of the usual veggies. No skimping on the fillings either! The buns have that characteristic flavor of being toasted with butter. My sides included the coleslaw and two dipping sauces  but there are other choices on the menu. All in all  this is not the most healthy meal  but it is pretty satisfying. I also sampled some of the fries. I'd rank them as average.   Atmosphere: During the lunch hour  this place is packed full of baby boomers. You can cut the nostalgia with a spork. It's pretty loud inside and during my one visit I noticed there was a LOT of trash and spilled dry condiments like pepper and salt on the ground. Gross. Watch out for the giant Big Boy out front. He's super creepy.  Service: Our waiter was very friendly  but seemed rather forgetful. We did get our food  but only after some order corrections.   Synopsis: Burgers are a bit pricey for what you get  but they do taste very fresh and delicious. It beats McDonald's at any rate.,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0

Parking ~ not a problem because there is a huge private parking in the back. This place opened couple of years ago  so you can tell its pretty new. And even when its super busy  its not super loud to the point you get a headach. Also  if you have kids  they are really nice cause they really try to put a smile on every kids face (I always see a few leaving with ballons). The waitress are super nice  and are one of the best waitresses I ever had! The food came fast  and my glass was never empty. Super friendly  and fast service? What more can you ask for?!

Anyway  the Bob's Big Boy went into the space formerly occupied by Baja Fresh (four Mexican restaurants in one block just didn't work)  and all they did was basically install booths and change the decor.  It is much more appealing now.  The restaurant has a comfortable and festive feel to it.    Now on to the food - I ordered the original double decker hamburger  and it was delicious.  It was one big sloppy mess  with their special sauce  but it was great.  Their special sauce (whatever exactly it is)  adds a kick to it that makes it much more tasty.  Fries were fresh  and in a way  reminded me of In N Out fries.  The double decker hamburger combo also came with a generously-sized side salad  with a choice of dressing.  I ordered dessert - an apple pie a la mode  and the slice was fresh and hot.  Dinner for one  with everything I've mentioned  complete with a soft drink  came out to about $15.00.

This Bob's Big Boy is definitely not the same quality as the Burbank location. They took over the old Baja Fresh location and made good use of the space  but it is definitely not an improvement.  The decor is the same old school 50's/ 60's diner type that Bob's is known for  but there's where the similarities end with the Burbank location.  The staff was barely cognizant that we were there. After a wait (I guess ample opportunity for first date conversation) they wanted our orders.  Ten minutes later  burnt greasy cold old looking french fries lathered in cheese came out. Er  this was not what I thought I'd be getting. Definitely sub par considering any number of places (cough  cough  Johnny Rockets or Pie n Burger) do their cheese fries warm and fresh and juicy looking. This plate just looked stale and old. My date's soup looked like it was freshly popped out of the can and equally cold. If they can't do these simple items  I hesitate to think what their entrees look like.   I was severely underwhelmed. Too bad because I really like the Bob's Big Boy in Burbank. Guess they can't all be good.,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

The service was friendly but seemed to get orders mixed up (to be fair  there were 8 of us and it is a new restaurant with new staff).  The food had some inconsistencies.  The burgers were good  as was the chili.  My chocolate shake was a generous serving size  good consistency  and decent flavor.   The fries were a pathetic  oily  soggy mess.  After all 8 of my parties meals were done  all that was left to be seen were heaps of uneaten fries.

I rather go to the Counter in Pasadena for better burgers or McD to be cheap.   After posting this review  I received this message from the owner.  Thanks Ho ! I assume you came for the free big boy day and then spit on us after we gave you free food.  Your kindness is greatly appreciated.  You are right McDonalds is way better than Bobs.  And Bobs is three times as expensive as the counter.  Do you realize that comparison to these restaraunts is wildly inaccurate ?

Staff is friendly  fast  and competent  and the restaurant is clean. Portions are generally good  food is decent but not amazing. Selection is underwhelming  and if you frequent here  you'll be running out of things to try.  That said  their patty melt is delicious  and their chili is the sort of cheap  tasty stuff that heart attacks are made out of. The burgers leave a bit to be desired and tend to be on the skimpy side.  It's a nice place to grab a bite if you're visiting South Pasadena late at night.,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1

Yes  I am channeling Debbie Gibson for my review of Bob's Big Boy. Sadly  the Bob's Big Boy of my childhood truly now exists only in my dreams."" My partner in crime and I found ourselves across from the Pasadena BBB at dinner time and in a fit of nostalgia thought we would check it out for old times sake.  As soon as we walked in we were greeted enthusiastically by Bob  not Big Boy Bob but waiter Bob. He was very friendly and quickly seated us and took our drink order. Our server Aria arrived quickly with the drinks and took our food order which consisted of the following:  Super Bob's Big Boy Combo ($9) Basically this is a larger version of the regular combo (bigger patties and more cheese) along with fries and a salad. I ordered this without the bun...I know  I know  but I am gluten challenged.  Chili spaghetti size ($9) This is a huge hamburger patty covered in chili spaghetti and comes with soup or salad.  Hot fudge sundae ($4) Vanilla ice cream  hot fudge  shipped cream  and cherries.  We ordered our salads with the world famous BBB Blue Cheese dressing. The salads arrived and we excitedly dug in...unfortunately my salad consisted of brown  slimey lettuce. I mean really brown  really slimey lettuce that you bought a month ago and suddenly find at the bottom of your crisper drawer. It was beyond gross. Our lovely waitress really tried to make it right. Eventually she brought me a new salad with fresh lettuce...but I was really kind of grossed out by the whole thing.  My burger arrived sans bun  and looked gray and lifeless on my plate. There was indeed alot of oozy cheese  and it tasted OK. It was not the epic burger experience of my childhood dreams.  The Chili spaghetti size was huge  and pretty much lived up to the memory my PIC had in his head of what it used to taste like. And seriously  the portion was monstrous.   The sundae was just an ordinary hot fudge sundae...not bad  not great...really just OK.  Overall the entire experience was OK. What really stands out here is the friendly  efficient  authentically great service. What does not stand out  sadly  is the food. I also have concerns about their standard operating practices...that brown  slimey lettuce should never have gone out on a plate and there were fruit flies flying around in the restaurant.

My memories of Bob goes back to high school...heh...you know  the caveman days  cuz I'm so old  ;) My HS use to steal the rival cities Bob and place it right in the middle of their football field.  We even stole it one year and put it on their football coaches front yard.   That's not why I love Bob's the way i do though.  Bob's was the place you went to for your first date.  Chocolate shakes  french fries and chocolate fudge cake.   And then there was the Bob's at our mall.  As a teen I spent hours in that mall with my friends and there was only one place we would eat.  Burger combo with a chocolate shake.  mmmmmm So is this one comparable? Of course!  It is reminiscent of the Burbank Bob's where I've spent many an after-club night at attempting to sober up....or dancing in the parking lot....or eating at a table while a friend sleeps head down on the table. On this particular night I ordered the cheeseburger wrapped in lettuce.  Scott ordered the bacon cheeseburger & Noah ordered the chili size.  We were all extremely happy with our orders and the waitstaff were always there when we needed them.  It's comfort food at it's best and they even change it up if you ask them to.  I drive by this location many times during the week and I can confirm that this place is busy all of the time.

Oh YEAH!  My family loves watching food network and my kids saw a special on Bob's Big Boy.  Ever since then have wanted to try it.  I heard they opened a smaller Bob's on Del Mar Blvd so we tried it when we visited Pasaden recently.

I'm used to the old school Big Boys with the spacious dining room  long counter seating & bright natural lighting from windows.  For this location  eat on the patio so you won't be shocked at how small the interior seating area is.  Service was friendly  attentive and responsive... 5 stars!  The food was very good.  My kids had cheeseburgers and fries.  They are actually cheeseburgers snobs so I was surprised when they told me how much they loved their cheeseburgers.  I asked them what makes the burger so good  they said the meat patty was what tasted the best.  I had the four-piece Pappy Parkers Fried chicken with salad (bleu cheese dressing)  cole slaw and french fries.   I always loved Bob's fried chicken and this serving did not disappoint... crispy broasted chicken  tender & juicy on the inside.  My son said it tasted better than KFC... and I have to agree with him.  The cole slaw was limp & bland  fries were hot & crispy and I almost forgot how great Bob's Blue Cheese salad dressing was... creamy & tangy.

I remember coming here religiously. Saturday I was finishing up with shopping and was waiting at the signal light at the corner of Del Mar and Lake Ave. While I was waiting for the WALK"" sign I could see the Bob's Big Boy off in the distance. I was hungry and decided that I would eat there tonight. As a kid my brother and I would bug my mother to take us to Bob's to get a hamburger and to get the comic books they use to sell showing Bob's Big Boy doing the adventure of the month. With that in mind I wanted to find out just what and why in the hell we use to come to Bob's in the first place.   This Bob's opened up  down from where I live  about 1 year ago and I felt my visit was lone over due. With hunger grumbling in my stomach I decided to try what they are know for  their hamburger. The people that work their are friendly and my server directed me to a booth from where I ordered my ""Super Big Boy"" with fries. I also ordered it with a cup of coffee.   Waiting for my burger I had I listen to some guy loudly talking in the next booth to someone about the second coming of Christ and how 1 million believers will disappear from the face of the earth when he comes. I'm use to blocking out B.S. so when my hamburger arrived I saw the second coming of the burger and when it came the saliva started to form. My server asked if ""there was anything else he could get?"" Deep in the recesses of my mind I was saying ""ya get the hell out of here so I could eat my burger.""  After taking a photo of my burger I grabbed it  held it up to my mouth and bit into it. Hot damn tamale it was juicy  tasty and delicious. Yes  it was everything that I had remembered from my childhood. With every bite kaleidoscope visuals of my childhood were bleeding thru. The meat was juicy and the cheese excentuated the taste  and I like how the 3 buns were toasted  with what I think was butter. I asked for grilled onions on my burger.

I noticed that this branch of Bob's opened on the site of a former Baja Fresh (which  by the way  was great--why did you leave  BF?).  This imparts a weird geographical vibe to the place; Bobses that I recall from my now-distant SoCal youth were large  sprawling  airy joints that took up like a city block (e.g.  the one in Burbank)  while this one is basically cramped and labyrinthine like the fast food restaurant it recently was.  I hadn't actually been to a Bob's Big Boy since I was a kid  and nostalgia was like 99% of the reason I was there.  And having now gone as an adult  I can safely say that the experience was nothing if not adequate.  The service was punctual and perfectly polite.  My turkey burger was solid  if unspectacular.  The iced tea tasted exactly like iced tea.  The prices were completely fair for what we got.  Bob's is utterly  completely  and entirely ... fine.

Which is not very often. You have to have your timing right so you don't get there at an off hour when nothing fresh is coming out. Otherwise  the quality of the food quickly deteriorates to be far worse than many of the restaurants I've ranked below. So it's really a hit or miss depending on freshness/warmth of food. I don't know why for the life of them why they don't keep the food warm!  -The food will put you to sleep. Out of the Indian food in Berkeley  this is probably some of the most heavy in terms of you feeling groggy/ lethargic afterwards. My reccomendation: Don't eat too much of the cream-based dishes  that's usually the culprit.   - NO variation in selection. I've been here a lot  and the dishes are almost always the same  save perhaps one dish which I don't bother touching most of the time anyways. So you can get bored of these place real fast  even if though the food is good.   Service: Pretty good in my opinion. The Nepali waitress usually there is very nice and greets you with a smile every time; the owners do not when they are managing but the service is still there. When my favorite dish was gone at 9pm  I requested more even though the place was deserted  and the waitress happily ordered more to be made from the kitchen. That's great customer service and a win in my book. Oh and your water glass is always full  what more can you ask from a buffet with no tip?   This is how I'd rank the taste of North Indian Restaurants in Berkeley (this takes into account everything  naan quality and consistency  curries  etc.) The list is not exhaustive yet  as this is my first review.  Now I know a lot of you are going to disagree  but keep in mind this is coming from someone who is a native Indian. I'm sure for non-Indians many of these restaurants seemingly serve great"" Indian food.  **I will keep updating this ranking list **  Updated 6/24/2010  1) Flavors of India / Kabab and Karahi (tie) 2) Himalaya 3) Urbann Turbann ($5 Cholay wrap: best value for your money  period). 4) Punjabi By Nature 5) Chaat Cafe 6) Priya 7) Viks (yeah  I know I'm going to get a lot of flak for this one  but it's true folks  severely overrated due to bandwagoning)  8) Breads of India (OK  but overpriced) 9) Biryani House 10) Khana Peena (the one on Solano  a little better than the other one) 11) Pasand (OK  but severely overpriced) 12) House of Curries (College) 13)  Kabana (Great food loses massive points for racially based treatment of customers) 14) Tandoor Kitchen 15) Khana Peena (the one on Shattuck  absolute trash  avoid)  16) Indus Valley Restaurant (literally serves frozen vegetable curries)  **Now if I called Khana Peena Shattuck trash  then you can imagine how the following are...yeah...these don't deserve to even be ranked**  House of Curries (Durant) Naan N Curry""",0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
_jg2zJPu7iNI0Ct0XNN3YQ,S61AyJYN-J-egDSgO9DChw,1,4,6/13/2010,3.5 Stars.  Pros - Very cheap $7.99 includes fountain soda refills & freshly made Naan. The decor is nicer than what you would expect for the price they charge.(BTW... look straight up at the ceiling for a pleasant surprise) Their food is tasty enough for me. My favorite dish was Chicken Tikka Marsala. I liked how they labelled each item.  Cons-  Barely enough variety but acceptable for $8. Some yelpers commented that their sauces are watery.(they mean thin consistency vs thick but not diluted or weak in flavor) I like thick curry sauce to pour over my rice.BTW their rice is like dorm rice.edible after you drown it with sauce.  Their Tandoori Chicken was OK. I expected it to have more flavor & alittle more spicy kick to it but it satisfied my craving for meat. It irritated me that the staff was very slow to replenish the Tandoori Chicken. I watched them restock the other items but it took them a longer time to bring out more Chicken. It took them so long that I had to ask them if they were working on it.They said they were aware but it still took them a long time even after I spoke up. I think they need to monitor the food more closely & cook more food before it runs out.( especially the Tandoori Chicken).  I plan to come back once in awhile but the low variety & slow restocking made a negative impression on me.,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0

The girl at the counter seemed as though she didn't give a shit  and had a slightly demeaning tone. I had to get up and remind them of our naan as no mention of bringing it to the table was mentioned  and I had to get our own water and refills  because even though it's wasn't even busy and the girl was just sitting there  she couldn't manage to see that we may need some refills.

The other important consideration would be the location. Right on oxford street.  Hubby and me walked in for dinner yesterday  and were impressed by the spread and the large Ganesha mural. What we were not impressed by was the quality of the spread.   Spinach and garbanzo  Broccoli masala  Vegetarian kurma  Rajma  Fresh beans in masala and Dal makhani. All these curries will get 2-3 on 5  mainly because the base sauce for many of them was the same and really not exciting from a mix of flavors perspective.  The naans will get a 4.5 from us. They were made fresh and were crispy and soft.   The rice was nothing to talk about  and the rice pudding was blah!  Didn't try the salads/raitha or the non vegetarian dishes.

The buffet is only 7.99  with endless naan  so you really can't go wrong for the price.    I can recommend the indian salad  the seasoned rice  the naan  the BBQ redened chicken drumsticks  and especially the chicken tiki masala.  A single plate of the mentioned food above would easily run 8-9 bucks at another Indian joint  so why not get here and get it endless?  Parking really sucks (street parking only).  Sometimes  the service is lacking too because there is only one waitress for the entire restaurant.  While the food is not spectacular  its been consistent for the times I've eaten here.

_jg2zJPu7iNI0Ct0XNN3YQ,hJ6vJMVJMZkS0fEDkTUSbQ,1,3,7/30/2012,"My friends and I stopped by this place yesterday while taking a break from the Olympics frenzy. At first glance  it doesn't seem like the place to go to  due to the lack of customers (at the time). The $7.99 buffet deal seemed too good to be true. But since we were all starving and didn't want to stray too far from our apartment  we gave it a shot. To make this review concise  here are some quick things to consider about this place before you decide to take that $7.99 chance.  Pros: - Chicken tikki masala. Wow. Sweet & creamy goodness. Get it. A LOT OF IT. - Naan is usually served hot  fresh  and as much as you want. If it's not there though  ask the waitress/waiter. - For a buffet  much of the food was quite decent. I could actually taste some quality in a dish.  Cons: - Not the greatest service. The waitress  after seating us  wasn't prone to helping us out unless we prodded her consistently. - I noticed that the salad  fruit and some of the curries weren't very fresh. Somewhat old actually. We ate around 7:30ish (which is late)  but still. Just a warning. - DON'T expect a lot of variety in these dishes. There weren't a lot of choices; at most  there were 7. A few were empty throughout the night  despite the waitress saying they were working on it.""  Overall  it filled my stomach well. It isn't a bad restaurant to go to for some near-broke college students that are completely devoid of food. But  it isn't a place I would want to go to again. One-time experience is more than enough.   Fun fact: Although they do play Punjabi music  it's funny that the workers in the back are blasting out Latin music  muffling out the Punjabi environment lol.""",1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0

Not all the dishes are absolutely amazing  but the ones that are are definitely enough to fill you up. I definitely recommend the Tikka Masala as it has a much more savory (and less sweet) taste than that of other South Asian restaurants in Berkeley.

(I'm surprised I'm even coherent enough to type proper English). It does just the trick: their coffee isn't super bitter or super sweet. It's a very refreshing experience. I love how Cafe Strada has this ambiance of--well  what a cafe should be: people having conversations  college students studying  and plenty of outdoor seating. I feel one of the things you should do in college is to actually get a cup of coffee  sit outside  and read a book. It's just one-of-things on your to-do list  I feel. I'm a huge fan of their Mocha Bianca  mainly because of its rich and aromatic feel. Creamy and light. Frothy and humble. Just what coffee should be.   -1 however for their whip cream they put on top of the coffee. It's TOO thick. Personally  I think if you're going to own a coffee shop  you should take time to make your own whip cream. Whip cream that foams just slightly  that gives"" slightly when you put it on top of hot coffee so that when you sip on it  it just froths in your mouth. I think their whip cream just doesn't cut it. It sticks to the walls of your mouth and doesn't give a bouncy texture.   Service is wonderful. They make their coffee fast and it's pretty decent.

It's also nice to make a Strada run at 11:30pm when you know you're going to be up late. The streets are dark and the crazy intersection is now deserted. The warmth of the coffee in your hands is a comforting reminder that Strada will always have your back when you need a caffeine boost.   I stick to the iced coffee or espresso.

I have tried their small MOCHA BIANCA  or white chocolate mocha  which is around $3. It is soooooooooooo sweet  and so wonderfully yummy.  Another time I was waiting for a friend and was guilted into buying a HOT APPLE CIDER for $2.75. They heat it using their foam latte machine thingy  which was appropriate for the chilly Berkeley night. The apple flavor was very rich and smooth. But  I can't figure out why I chose to pay $3 for warm apple liquid...And  on top of that  my friend and I moved our meeting on campus. So that guilt trip was FOR NAUGHT.

_kukye9j79yaTjjedDwrcQ,K5Tt2nJHcJk0kRFbK51vIw,2,2,8/18/2012,"Strada is possibly the most overrated cafe in America.  I say this based on years of experience living and working in Berkeley  traveling  and Strada actually being rated one of the best cafes in America by some source that probably has never been there.  Don't get me wrong  the location and ambiance are outstanding.  The ample outdoor seating area which flows into the cozy indoor seating really works well  and is a nice cornerstone to College and Bancroft.  If they didn't completely botch the three most important factors for a college cafe  it would be a great study or hang out spot.  In order of importance  Strada completely fails at the following:  1. Coffee 2. Seating 3. Power/internet  1. The coffee is atrocious.  Anyone who tells you otherwise likes grotesquely overfilled pint-glass americanos and charred-bean cappuccinos.  This is no hyperbole; it is that bad.  I don't think the baristas"" receive any training whatsoever other than ""push this button till full"".  They will seriously extract the hell out of every shot until the water runs clear.  Another big pet-peeve: they give you to-go cups when you ask for a regular cup at least 50% of the time.  2. Every table is totally fubar  bent beyond the point of no return.  Is there anything worse than trying to type and having your lopsided table spill your coffee everywhere?  I think not.  It's actually really funny to periodically take notice of all the people fiddling with rolled up napkins  rotating  and propping--it's a fools errand people  the tables suck as much as the coffee.  3. This is a catch all category of amenities.  There are approximately 5 outlets for the 75 or so person capacity.   The internet  i'm pretty sure  is based on cup and string  carrier pigeon  or telegraph technology--quite possibly all in series.  And the propane heating system?  Lets just put it this way  if your replaced the people with eggs  some would be cooked in a minute and others would be preserved for a milenia.  In summary.  Strada sucks.  It has always sucked  and has actually gotten worse over the past 6 years.  But they will always get business because of their location.  My advice  buy your coffee anywhere else and use their tables.""",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

What I love about this cafe is the outdoor seating area surrounded by boxed plants and greenery which makes me feel as if I am sitting in a courtyard.   The food is not why I go here  and the espresso drinks are decent.  On my most recent visit I had a cappuccino which I thought was actually very good  with silky foam and not too much milk.    What I am about to say  I say with utmost affection.  The patrons here are often the nerdy types  representing students  faculty  and staff from the nearby law school  business school  architecture and chemistry departments.  This also reminds me of one guy friend of mine with whom I visited Cafe Strada long time ago and he introduced me to steam milk with almond syrup.  I don't know why  I just remember that it was a sunny morning and I was surprised at his choice of drink but I now sometimes get it here too  and it makes me happy.  I have other memories of this place  too.  Like a long long time ago it used to be called Cafe Roma  then because of lease problem I think the ownership changed and the name changed to Cafe Strada.

My problem with a lot of dim sum places is that the food in the carts gets stale and isn't always served at its peak. Luckily for Chang Luong  they don't cook any of the dim sum until you order it.

By ok  I mean it tastes like something I could buy at 99 Ranch and reheat.  They serve dim sum all day so I suspect that's probably what they do.  They're fried items taste fresher but I think that has more to do with the nature of it's cooking process more than any sort of quality.  Their dishes are cheap but small.  Their baos are TINY!  Order two if you have three or more people.  If you're desperate  Chang Luong will do.  But if you can  drive out to SF.  Or better yet  BART it.

Unfortunately  the bad was BAD! I should've known better than to order from a place in the main college area  but was attracted to the free delivery  decent prices  and seemingly authentic menu. Also  I've loved the food from Sun Hong Kong  which is also in the college hood. Too bad it's an $8 delivery fee at SHK!  I got: spicy beef chow fun  sauteed snow peas  salt and pepper pork chops  and chicken wings. In hindsight  I realize the menu is not cantonese-oriented  and more szechuan. Makes sense that the spicy beef chow fun was the most palatable item.   Other than that  everything was greasy  disgustingly battered  and I could practically taste how dirty the kitchen might be. Forget eating leftovers for a few more meals - that was $28 worth of garbage.

_mv3DhRD3L3okFXYjxX_Cg,5Q-47TdDDTrjngUFiZ-ljQ,1,3,3/14/2011,"Discovered this restaurant when I was looking for a place to eat before a an Asian American Film Festival showing at the Pacific Film Archive.   It's located in a building that's occupied by 4 different restaurants -- Lotus Little House (on the street) and Kimchee Garden (in back at the end of a walkway which may have been a driveway in the past) on the 1st floor and Chang Luong & Cafe Durant on the 2nd floor  which are accessed via a stairway on the left in a stairway (that's hidden from the street) in the walkway towards KimChee Garden.  Chang Luong is located in the back of the building opposite Cafe Durant which is in the front and offers an outdoor patio overlooking Durant Avenue.      I've eaten at KimChee Garden and Cafe Durant before and they were ok -- not awful or great -- as far as I can remember.  However  KimChee Garden was closed  Lotus House looked too noisy and cramped and didn't feel like having Mexican food and it was raining  which ruled out Cafe Durant.  So  that just left Chang Luong.  The room was empty and looked somewhat dark and dingy -- took a table under the only skylight which offered a little light.   Was just thinking of getting some BBQ pork won ton or chow mein for a quick bite but was surprised to learn they served dim sum.  So  ordered several basics: shrimp dumplings - ha gow  tripe  foon jow - chicken feet  don tat - custard tarts   cha seiu bao - steamed BBQ pork buns   see jup pai gwat - pork spare ribs w/black bean sauce and new mai gai - steamed glutenous rice filled w/chicken  chinese sausage and other things wrapped in a lotus leaf.   Was then surprised that the dim sum was pretty good -- not great but not awful either.  The ha gow was first rate  the tripe and chicken feet were also very good but I would have preferred a little more spice  the pork duns were ok -- not very large and no much filing but tasted ok.  The custard tarts were slightly overcooked but ok.  The pai gwat was a little undercooked and didn't have enough black beans but was ok and the new mai gai was ok too.    There was a little mix up when I asked for gai lat (chinese mustard) and the foreign-born waitress thought I said gai lan"" -- mustard greens.  Blamed me in Chinese for not speaking clearly but my guest said she heard me ask for it correctly -- it's one of those foreign born towards American born Chinese insults/conflicts that only ABCs will understand.  BTW  got the gai lat but it was very watery and runny -- should have been much thicker.    Guess the waitress was too pissed w/me to serve us again and another waitress (American born) helped us from then on.   Told her about the misunderstanding and she said the other waitress probably misunderstood because she's from China; speaks Mandarin and only a little Cantonese.    No service problems after that.     I wouldn't go out of my way to eat at Chang Luong again but would if I'm in the area and am in the mood for dim sum -- and not Mexican  Korean  Indian  hot dogs  hamburgers  pizzas  etc. which are all options only feet away..  The food was fine  even if the decor were a bit lacking.  But  if it's a sunny day and you want to drink some a beer (and eat some Mexican food  which isn't required if you buy a beer) out on the patio  Cafe Durant would be the better choice.""",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Not only are the prices incredibly reasonable  the amount of food you get for the price is great. The restaurant was busy (and also really nice) and completely full but it took only a couple minutes for our food.   My single char burger with cheese  the fries  and the mocha shake were all fantastic  flavorful  hot and fresh. I keep reading people comparing this to In-n-Out; it's most definitely an accurate comparison  and having had both I'd say they're both equally as good  but Habit's fries were much better. But I don't usually like comparing restaurants to other restaurants - if you want In-n-Out  go there  if you want Habit  have Habit. But both places are different and have their own unique good things about them.  I'd most definitely recommend Habit and would return the next time I'm down there  and actually can't wait to.

The waffle was nice and caramelized  and I was happily surprised to find actual little pearls of sugar inside the waffle! One waffle was more than enough to satisfy both mine and Nam's sweet tooth.

This truck simply sells waffles. Just waffles.   Even more strange is that it seems to have only a few different options for that waffle. Plain. With Nutella and best of all with Fosselman's Ice cream   Now it's not just that this waffle would be good if it was just by itself. Because the waffles are indeed damn delicious. But you add in Fosselman's Ice Cream and you have heaven.   For all of you who didn't grow up in the San Gaberial Valley  Fosselman's Ice Cream is that go to local ice cream producer that every town seems to have. The one that all the locals swear by.   So you put that high end quality ice cream on your already warm and tasty waffle and you have yourself some crazy sorts of deliciousness. Again  the simplicity to this truck is just refreshing.   Besides that  it's a waffle truck. No need to complicate it up with other menu items. They make the waffles good and cheap and that's all you need to be told to sell you on it when you see the truck parked on the curb.   Service was fast as there wasn't much of a line anyway.

From having to drop dat knowledge on us peoples about what makes Liege waffles different from Brussels waffles to all the food truck festivals they've been a part of to the cray cray marketing (Loveline  NPR  etc.?).  Anyway  I've had this bookmarked to review for almost a year. I tried them out at a food truck meetup in Puente Hills. The line for Waffles de Liege was long  but they killed the wait like a champ.  What did I order? I forgot  but it was something with nutella and ice cream for sure. Like everyone else has said  they source their ice cream from Fosselman's  which is another one of my favorites over in downtown Alhambra.  Anyway  I've been made a fan of Liege waffles by the likes of these dudes. It's a different batter that makes the waffles denser and it seems that they take much better to caramelization (you know--the GOOD stuff) when cooking. This caramelization creates this ridiculous crunch and al dente texture on the exterior while leaving the center extremely soft and fluffy.  Fucking. Magic.  TL;DR - Buy a waffle.

You might think: great  what's up w/ this quirky word...like  is it short for spectacular whoop-de-doos"" or something?  Maybe...But seriously--there IS such thing as Speculoos!!!  So Speculoos  I think  is an obligate food-to-die-for phenomenon.  Before I explain this new food fondness  I ambulated w/ CSULB + Yelp buddy Viet T  plus 2 other college buddies  at the Too Fat Too Furious Friday food truck round-up at Best Buy  near the Imperial Hwy/Beach Blvd intersection.  Out of the 7 food trucks (of ~15?!) we spent our hard-earned $$$ for  I decided to Yelp first about Waffles de Liege  signifying the $4.50 carbohydrate.  I let my avid sweet tooth friends do all the choosing  eventually customizing in the Original Liege Waffle w/ Fosselman's Chocolate-Covered Strawberry Ice Cream  fresh strawberries & bananas  & Speculoos--which was accidentally on the side  rather than spread intentionally & lovingly on that squared carb--for a whopping total of $9.25 *o_O.  Honestly  friends  WITHOUT Speculoos  this dessert would have been rated 2.5 stars--maybe less.  The positive part was that giant  hefty scoop of ice cream  guaranteed at 1000% that at every bite of this very thick & subtly buttery-tasting Belgian waffle  there will be a forkful of the smooth-to-""fork"" ice cream to drag along.  Deng  if we remembered to grab one plastic knife  it would have been almost trouble-free to mess this treat up =_=.  Yet  I'm terribly sorry for my friend who chose the chocolate-covered strawberry ice cream  but I frankly thought this dessert was awfully PRICEY for a boring sweet taste that I instinctively rather find crappy parking & head to DTLA's Syrup Desserts.  Thus  that waffle desperately needed at least 1 outstanding ingredient to enliven this showy dessert...  ...And that's all thanks to Speculoos.  At additional 75 cents  it's a Biscoff cookie-made ""butter"" more easily spread & scooped up--AND more costly by the jar--than equally coined Nutella.  Viet & I were trying to decode what constitutes this pleasant  spinal cord-tingling zing  & after minutes of what was that ""cereal [we] used to eat when [we were] little "" Speculoos was best reminisced as a velvety  European-style Golden Grahams  taken as liberally needed for the waffle/ice cream/fruit combination.  If this truck is driven to the area at ambulate-friendly distance  say  the Picnic at the Plaza at Los Alamitos  I wouldn't mind ordering the waffle w/ this nostalgic treat  fresh fruit  and the out-of-the-blue Blueberry ice cream from Fosselman's xD.  In the end  I will give Waffles de Liege a better-than-average 3.5 stars--yet optimistically more if I can gobble the aforementioned all by myself o_o.

It has been a long wait  but finally there is a gourmet food truck serving up real Belgium Liege"" waffles in Southern California. Not only are they making killer fresh waffles but are also pairing it up with some great ice cream and toppings.  Lets start with the waffle. They make a traditional Belgium-style waffle called a Liege. The Liege waffle is made from dough so it tends to be a touch sweeter and chewier. This is not the waffle most restaurants serve in the U.S.  which are made from a batter and are called ""Brussels"" waffles. This is only my second time eating a Liege waffle but I really like the crunchy exterior and chewy interior texture of it.  Waffles de Liege offers a number of different toppings like Nutella  chocolate  caramel  whipped cream and fresh fruit like bananas and strawberries. You also have the option to top your waffle with Fosselman's Ice Cream. The ice cream is hand-made in LA and the truck carries several flavors at a time. There are no preservatives and it was extremely fresh.  I tried a couple of their waffles and ice cream combinations  a waffle with bananas  chocolate-covered strawberry ice cream dusted with powdered sugar and drizzled with chocolate syrup and one with fresh cut bananas  French Vanilla ice cream  powered sugar and Speculoos. We enjoyed the Speculoos the most. Speculoos is a spread that looks like peanut butter but tastes like a Belgian ""biscuit"" or cookie. That is because it is basically a gingerbread cookie turned into a spread. You have to try it. It is a great complement to the waffles.  I have a feeling Waffles de Liege is going to become very popular. Being new  they still have a few kinks to work out. Consistency was the only complaint I heard. One of the ones we tried from a friend was over cooked but the ice cream softened it up   so it was not a huge issue. The two we ordered were perfectly cooked so I am confident that they will straighten this out soon. I wonder if they would consider expanding their menu to include savory waffles in the future?""",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

Delicious!  When you first bite into one  the crispiness gives way to a caramelized sugar cake like consistency that holds up well even with the sauce and ice cream.  It is sweeter than a regular waffle  and you can taste the pearls of sugar.  They are great as a dessert  but I would even have one for breakfast with the fruit options which included strawberries and bananas.  Other toppings include caramel  white chocolate  nutella  as well as an assortment of Fosselmans ice cream flavors.        The dough is made fresh daily  and they also serve Jones coffee  which makes it even better that the ice-cream and coffee are both made locally.      The two baby faced owners were in the truck  and after reading about them getting locked out of their truck a few weeks back  and the waffle maker not working  it looks like they are ready for business.

Because of this waffle obsession  I had been wanting to try this truck for a while. I loved that you can pick out your toppings to make your own creation  and I decided to go with banana and caramel. Normally I'd be all over the Nutella rather than the caramel  but since it was so hot out when I visited this truck  the caramel sounded better.  There was a bit of line to order  but it moved quickly. A bit over $5 wasn't alarmingly expensive. After waiting for a few minutes for my waffle  my name was called  and I was a met by a worker with an attitude. I said  Yes for Nikki "" and he looked at me suspiciously and barked at me to hand over my number. Yikes! Food trucks are usually so friendly. I found the waffle to be very hard and overly sweet. I know that these are a different style waffle  but I just found it to be too crunchy. They not put many slices of banana on it either.

I've only tried the waffles as is (without ice cream)  but next time i will definitely try that. They have Fosselman's Ice Cream from Fosselman's from Alhambra  California. The flavor of ice cream they have is some kind of bacon ice cream  which is a special type of ice cream just for them.  What i love about the waffle is the Belgian Pearl Sugar that is put in the waffles. Every bite you take  you can taste the sugar crystals breaking in your mouth  which makes the waffles so tasty.

I opted for a waffle with ice cream.  The ice cream is from Fosselman's (a very famous old-fashioned ice cream parlor near Pasadena).  The waffle was good.  It was not soggy but also not too crunchy or dry.  It had a good flavor.  I topped the waffle with caramel syrup and pistachio ice cream.  None of the toppings were great  but it was still a satisfying dessert.  I did not like my visit to Fosselman's that much (I thought the ice cream had too much butterfat and the flavors were not distinct)  but I thought the ice cream here was pretty decent.  Service was friendly and quick.  Prices were a little high for a good but not great dessert  but it was a very large portion (with the waffle and the large scoop of ice cream  it definitely felt like a dessert meant for sharing).  I am not a huge fan of food trucks  but I did think Waffles de Liege was pretty decent.  It is a good food truck if you are looking to share a sweet dessert with ice cream.

Liege waffles are belgian waffles that are made with chunks of sweet pearl sugar that caramelize as the batter cooks  forming a crispy outer layer. The waffle we ordered was smothered in nutella  strawberries  and Fosselman's banana heath ice cream (this was also my first time tasting Fosselman's ice cream - holy fuck). I could've done without the strawberries  but everything else blew my mind.  The waffle was incredible. The caramelized pearl sugar crackled in my mouth with every bite and sent my brain into a state of confused ecstasy.

Maybe  it is because I am fairly systematic in doing my research before trying one or maybe it is just dumb luck. Either way  I will take it.  Now  I need to put something on the table  before last night  I had NEVER heard of this truck. So  I cannot really take credit for this one; it was purely dumb luck that they happened to show up at the Los Alamitos event. And  to tell you the truth  I wasn't much interested in trying their waffles. I tend to be more of a traditionalist when it comes to dessert  if it doesn't have chocolate  not dessert. In fact  I subscribe to the theory that apple pie is actually just fruit.  So  I really have my lovely wife to thank for this discovery  as she announced  Just so you know  we are getting a waffle "" after enjoying meals from The Lime and Flip Trucks. For some reason  I felt like being easy go (doesn't happen often) and I surrendered to her whim. Boy  am I glad I did.  I must say I was intrigue after quickly reading a few reviews in the cold and dark  desperately trying to make sure we selected the right dessert. And  we did. Holy Moly!  We went with the holiday special  which consists of THE best yummy waffle  amazing pumpkin ice cream and an excellent whipped cream finished with a powered cinnamon (I think). Now  I realize a few of you might be wondering  ""But Scott  this goes against your own dessert rule? Where is the chocolate?"" Like I said  I was feeling very easy going and went with the window's recommendation.  Now  usually any dessert without chocolate leaves me wanting a little more. This more than exceeded my expectations. The waffle was both crispy and gooey at the same time. The truck's special Belgian waffle recipe didn't disappoint. In fact  I was actually convinced that there was apple inside the waffle and even went and asked. The answer  ""No  dude...""  This thing was sooooo freakin' good that between my wife  me and the toddler  it was gone in a flash. It literally was one of the best desserts I have ever had  and I have had some pretty darn good treats around the world.

The Waffle de Liege truck is a dessert food truck dedicated to all things waffles. All their waffles are made in truck  which is cool.  Their menu is actually quite large. They have a few waffle combos you can choose from or you can get creative and make your own yummy waffle concoction.  My wife and I decided to create and split our own waffle. This is what we made;   Liege Waffle topped with crunchy speculoos spread  banana's  strawberries and Fosselman's vanilla bean ice cream   First off  major props to this truck for using Fosselman's ice cream and not some awful store brand.  Our waffle creation was fantastic. The waffle itself was light and fluffy. The bananas and strawberries were both perfectly ripe. Of course the ice cream was amazing but the star of this dessert was the speculoos. That spread tastes exactly like ground up graham crackers and ginger bread cookies. I like this spread almost as much as I like peanut butter...almost.   My only complaint is this truck is crazy pricey. Our creation set us back ten bucks  which is a crazy amount. They take credit cards though so that's a plus.   If you haven't tried Speculoos before hunt down this truck and get a waffle topped with buckets of the stuff. It's amazing!  Or you can do what I did immediately after I left the truck  which is go to Trader Joe's and buy a jar of their cookie butter (I Googled who sold the stuff). It's basically the same thing although they only have it in creamy  not crunchy. Boooo,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0

Waffles de Liege really holds a winning waffle recipe. One of the things I despise the most about waffles is the lack of crispness of the exterior  but don't worry about that with Waffles de Liege  its cooked to perfection.   The imported Belgian pearl sugar that's incorporated into the waffle dough gives the exterior of the waffle that nice crispy golden caramelized texture while the interior holds a soft yet chewy consistency.   The waffle itself is not overly sweet which is why the spreads and syrup options accompanies really well with the waffle. If you want a bit of that refreshed feeling in your palate  than I'd suggest you add some fruit toppings as well.   Who can say no to ice cream? The truck carries Fosselman's ice cream (4 flavors change/rotate from time to time) so order a scoop of your desired ice cream on top of your waffle to get the delectable combination's of warm  crispy  chewy  cool  and refreshing taste all throughout your mouth.

It was a really good dessert but there were a few technical errors that are causing me to lean away from that fourth star.  Ted waited in line for 20 minutes. The line wasn't that long it just moved at a snail pace. To me  the ever efficient  waffles should be easier than this. Since they serve pretty much only waffles  and they can see they have a line  I would recommend they just cook them fast. They will go out the door just as fast as they are made. This keeps the waffles fresh and the service fast. They seemed stressed.  When we finally made it up front we ordered one waffle with coffee ice cream on top  caramel and whipped cream. Sounds like a winning combination to me. We waited about ten more minutes and we walked away waffle in hand; tired but very excited.  The waffle batter is sweeter than any waffle I have ever tasted. It's very good  especially in dessert form. Our was burnt on the bottom which was very disappointing and odd. When you are trying to make a product fast one anticipates it being a little under cooked. This burning meant that we could have had a better waffle faster. Sad.  Fosselman's is one of the best ice creams I have ever had and their coffee ice cream on top was no different. It was creamy  coffee joy in ice cream form. Add the caramel and whipped cream and you have the makings for a perfect evening.   Next time I would like to try them when they are a little less frazzled. If we had been in and out in a reasonable amount of time with a non burnt waffle in hand this may have been a 5 star review.,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0
_QNKVyihvoeCL8873l8x8Q,hzb3V3Za_A5IqnvegRff7A,1,2,7/17/2011,So disappointed...   Tried this truck at the Eat Real Festival this weekend with fellow yelper Sharon L. It looked delicious and seemed so appetizing. We ordered their signature waffle with strawberry ice cream with chocolate bits inside and chocolate and caramel drizzle.   It looked so yummy  but first bite and... Meh. It tasted as if the waffle had been left out for way too long to the point that the dough was stale. Given how quickly the food came out  it clearly wasn't freshly made. It was too hard and too chewy and it didn't have that crunchy and soft texture that good waffles have.   For $5... we got half of a very small terribly tasting waffle and a small scoop of strawberry chocolate chip ice cream.    No Thanks.,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
_UyjMqhiaP1n9WC5Xt3Ngw,_vu1wvg5AWEdosMoQP9mfA,2,5,1/27/2012,We recently had our son and daughter-in-law's rehearsal dinner at Blue. We are from out-of-town so we took a special trip up to SLO to check out restaurants to hold the rehearsal dinner at. We visited several restaurants that day. When we came to Blue  they were actually closed. We didn't realize it until we tugged on the door and found that it was locked. As we were walking away  Eric  owner and chef  opened the door and graciously invited us in. He showed us around  talked about their menu and answered all of our questions. We came away with a great first impression. I called Patricia  owner and wife of Eric  and she promptly returned my call and answered all of my questions. My husband and I ventured up to SLO one more time and had dinner at Blue. The food was superb and the service was impeccable! That was it! We knew this was the place to have the rehearsal dinner!!   Patricia worked with us on the planning of the menu and other details of the evening. A special menu was printed with our son and daughter-in-law's name on it  along with all of the wonderful selections for the evening. They even allowed us to come early and put our personal touch on the decor  up in the loft  which by itself was already inviting!  Needless to say  the evening was a huge success! Our guests loved the atmosphere  raved about the food  enjoyed the wine  and appreciated the attentive service! Please  if you are considering a place to have a meaningful gathering  go to Blue!

I didn't read the yelp reviews before coming here and ended up bringing my baby to dinner when visiting the area.  The staff was very accommodating with the stroller.  But I felt kind of bad for ruining the ambiance of the other diners.   Thankfully it wasn't too crowded and the baby was mellow throughout the dinner.  Oysters: Fantastic!  We got a selection of oysters from different regions.  All were fresh and incredibly tasty.  Herb Roasted Halibut: Perfectly prepared!  The fish was light and well seasoned.  The accompanying ravioli was al dente.  Divine!  For dessert - go for the dark chocolate fondue.  It was served with fresh fruit  moist pound cake and crunchy almonds.  Fantastic!

The apps were excellent  which is why the second star came into play / ahi  cheese plate were the best.  They did forget about our other 2 but that tied to the service end of it.  Meals were good  the steak special isn't what we thought but the other 2 which were the lamb and the fish special were high in flavor.  The service on the other hand was very poor.  We brought two bottles of wine with us to celebrate the evening and waited 15 minutes for the first to get opened after we had to ask.  From then on  we were literally on our own.  We poured every last sip ourselves  not out of desire but out of necessity.  The waitress seemed very into her friend who was sitting at the end of the room  that by itself isn't the end of the world but not what we expected from such a highly reviewed restaurant and also considering the price.

No frozen butts on the sidewalk for this girl  a warm bar stool and a glass of wine is how I take in my parades.   Eric and Patricia Korbel own and run this well-oiled machine and I crown Eric as one of the best and most consistent chefs anywhere.  One of the capping achievements of the Korbel's is their unparalleled wait staff.  They are all well trained  attentive and make each meal feel like a celebration.  This evening we were lucky enough to get Nicole  a gorgeous girl with a personality and table presence that is unsurpassed.   We started with Spicy Lentil Soup with cr\u00e8me frach\u00e8 that had the heat and protein needed to shake the cold off your bones.  This chef's revelation was perfect for the evening and tasted even better sopped up with fresh Provencal bread from Farb's Bakery.  The bread with a sprig of rosemary on the softened butter is one of the reasons I visit Korbel at Blue.   Our next treat was the Seared Foie Gras of Duckseasoned with fleur de sel de gu\u00e9rande  served with huckleberry waffle  tiny caramelized onion  and a ginger scented port wine reduction.  I thought the waffle was going to be weird  but it brought out the flavor of the liver and balanced it with sweetness.  This dish was so rich and amazing  I could of eaten four more.   We shared the Hoisin Marinated Chicken Lettuce Wrap; with several fresh butter lettuce leafs that are used as a taco that you stuff with chicken.  This is one of my favorite appetizers and I order it every time I dine at Blue  you should try it  the mixture of spicy meat  salty peanuts  and the buttery lettuce are a symphony of flavors.   As we watched the marching bands  gymnastics teams  and preschools march down the street we ordered six raw oysters.  Two each from Washington  New York and Maine that were freshly shucked and iced  served with red chili mignonette sauce and a horseradish/tomato sauce  these delicate creatures were so fresh  the barnacles on the shell were still alive.   Instead of dessert  we ordered a Potato Onion Pierogi with smoked sturgeon  and sturgeon caviar.  A dap of sour cream in the middle  topped with amazing display of culinary genius off and made our palates sing along with the Christmas carols.,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1

I also had to give in and order the foie gras with the waffle. I never saw that combo before but with the sauce it was PERFECTION.

We have been here twice so far  once being on New Years Eve and we got stellar service with a packed house. Reservations recommended for holidays or peak times  the owner even called me to confirm my new years reservation.The food has been worth the money- delicious and with surprisingly huge portions. For our new years meal I got the duck (that I sadly couldn't even finish it was so large)  he got the ribeye  we shared the caesar salad and I had a glass of wine and the bill came to about $100 including the tip. Our second trip was on a Tuesday and it was a much better atmosphere without so many people. When the restaurant is full  the tables are a little bit too close together to have a very romantic dinner. He again got the ribeye and I tried the seared ahi which was delicious! They pass the water glass test- our glasses were never empty throughout dinner. Definitely worth going for a nice date night or celebratory meal.,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

The ONLY great martini in San Luis Obispo.  Still five stars for me.  Regarding the complaints of certain reviewers that it is overpriced.  I can only say that SLO prices compete with San Francisco prices and we know the rent is higher in SF  and they also have to pay for health care for their workers.

It is located inside a restored 1930's building and the inside is very modern and sleek.  We started at the bar and order an Old Fashioned which turned into two.  Finding a good Old Fashioned is hard to come by but the bartender here did not disappoint.  We then were seated upstairs in a nice small exclusive corner overlooking the lower level.  We started off with oysters and the Potato Onion Pierogi appetizer  but of which were fantastic.  I went with the Snake River Farms New York Steak and the Caesar Salad.  The salad was topped with fresh anchovies and tasted like what a Caesar Salad should taste like.  The steak was cooked to perfection and made with a Cabernet reduction with a side of Maytag Blue Butter.   It was one of the best steaks I've had in a while.  The service was excellent and they kept the wine flowing.  There are some great dining choices in SLO  but this one is definitely one to add to the list.,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1

The Bad: Weird smell at the bar (something with the wood?) Gets really busy and loud.  I'm only giving four stars because I didn't have dinner  so this isn't a full review. Anyway  4 stars for dessert and drinks. Came here on a Thursday when Farmers was in full swing. This may have been a bad choice because it was extremely busy  but my experience really didn't suffer. Right when we walked into the bar someone approached us. There was no waiting to see if we should seat ourselves or what  we were promptly helped and made space for at the bar. Looking at the drinks for only about 2 minutes the bartender asks us what we would like. Telling her I would like dessert she brings me the dessert list. The list is not extensive but the choices all sounded amazing. Decided on the mixed berry cobbler  with creme fraise ice cream. YUM. I split it and when I took the first bite I realized you don't split dessert here. After fighting over the last bite  we enjoyed our cocktails. He had a manhattan  I had some wine. The drink list was ridiculous. You could come here for a year straight and still not have tried everything. They have this absinthe machine.. looked daunting. Wine  drink  dessert came out to be like $30  tip included. Not bad for a nice time. Next I need to try dinner. If anything on the menu is as good as that dessert it will be a sure winner.,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
_UyjMqhiaP1n9WC5Xt3Ngw,1sMUcEf8Q1xghMPeYTVzqQ,1,3,6/25/2010,Blue has food that tastes good and keeps a pretty high level of sophistication  but always manages to feel overpriced.   Order the specials  as in my experience  they seem to outshine the menu's staples. I've enjoyed venison medallions and veal liver (this was killer  I must say) from the 'specials' list but have also had dry halibut and overly-salted fois gras from the standard menu.  The wine list leaves something to be desired. It's stocked with brands that were pretty good five years ago but lacks any coverage of emerging Central Coast stars. The liquor options are quite sufficient  however.  Atmosphere is private or social (restaurant and bar seating) and the service is pretty good.  Still  I could have food that completely outshines Koberl's for 2/3 the price in any major city.,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1

As a matter of fact  when we start with the drinks  it is hard to work our way over to the restaurant since the drinks and the appetizers are so good.  BEST Martinis in town  and best mixed drinks...and they will accommodate weird requests and special instructions with ease and good humor.   Also best quality appetizers and small plates  with portions large enough to make a meal.  We love to get a table  get a drink tab going  and order from the appetizer menu.  Great foie gras with a crispy waffle in an actual reduction sauce  or tempura  crisp light calimari  or a half dozen oysters raw  followed by a half dozen oysters baked a la Rockefeller  succulent and delicious.  The bar scene is also about the only place in town for professionals  and not totally populated with students. The salmon is my favorite entree  but my carnivorous buddies have devoured the rack of lamb  the filet  and the pork chops  all with happy faces.  You can choose your wine from a separate wine list  with enough reds and whites to please anyone. The bananas foster were so good we practically licked the plate  and I have fond memories of the tarte tatin from another occasion  and large enough potions to share.

_UyjMqhiaP1n9WC5Xt3Ngw,#NAME?,1,4,11/15/2010,What's not to like. This place oozes class. The venue itself is a great balance of exposed brick walls with just the right amount of exposed wood trim lightly decorated. The tin ceiling is a darker color so it blends right in with the rest of the d\u00e9cor. The building is pretty old and is part of the original SLO Downtown core giving it all kinds of character. The crowd can be fairly divers but always friendly. If you arrive before 9pm there is a good chance you can find an open spot in the bar area. The bartenders know their craft and you can rest assured that whatever you order will be poured or mixed correctly. The service is among the best in SLO with a strong consistency. On our last visit my friends (one visiting SLO for the first time) were so impressed how even our waters were refilled constantly during a busy time (Don't forget to tip well).    This is my fianc\u00e9e's favorite bar in San Luis Obispo.  The place has changed a bit over the years but I have been living in the LA area since I graduated from Cal poly in 2006 so I can't comment on the more recent changes to entertainment and music. When I attended Cal Poly they use to have live music and DJ's playing after 10pm but not sure if they still do this. I think some live Jazz would really hit the spot.   We have not had a full sit down meal here but we have tried pretty much every appetizer and it is hard to go wrong. The food I have seen served to other patrons looks delicious. We plan to do a full meal next time we are in San Luis Obispo but for the time being this review is about the bar and the appetizers.   On this visit we enjoyed their Gruyere Onion & Prosciutto Tart and Cheese Plate. The tart was well balanced and played out each of the ingredients without one overpowering the other (Perfect wine food). We found the cheese plate to be our favorite (3 cheese house selection)  particularly the La-Tur Italian cheese a creamy and buttery blend of Goat  Sheep  and Cow. The cheese platter had all the elements for pairing with wine and other spirits. The honey glaze paired will with several of the cheeses and the pear slices.   We had drinks ranging between wine and Calvados French Apple Brandy. Wine selection is wonderful and they have a $20 corkage fee. My friend was impressed they had Calvados French Apple Brandy as he has only seen it at a handful of places in California  always super classy places. My other friend loved the scotch selection and pricing (Almost a $1 per year  making it a great value). Being from LA the drink pricing seemed very fair  they only carry quality stuff.   If you are looking for a classy joint to enjoy great wine food and the perfect drinks to go with your food  this place will not disappoint you. Also don't forget the blue cheese stuffed olives  you can asked for a couple on the side  my fianc\u00e9e is in love with them. I don't even like olives but I enjoyed them the couple of times I've had them with my martini. Like I said earlier  the only improvement I would suggest is some live Jazz (This may already be happening  but not the Saturday night I was there).,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

My friend and I split some small plates even though the dinners looked amazing. The seared sea scallops with edamame puree was delish as was the beef carpaccio.

I will say it is a gorgeous restaurant with attentive  friendly & knowledgeable staff. We enjoyed the quiet ambiance at a relaxed pace  I do love a restaurant that does not make you feel as though your table is needed and you should be eating faster.

I committed alcohol blasphemy and ordered non-coastal wines because I was scouting half-bottles but the overall wine  beer  and cocktail list is impressive. If nothing else come here for a drink and the oysters which were hands down the best I've ever had. I would have preferred warm bread but it was tasty nonetheless. The pork and NY strip were cooked perfectly although I could have done without the cabernet reduction on my beef - I'm more of a purist when it comes to steak. Finished off the meal by inhaling the bananas foster napoleon while enjoying an alcohol laden coffee. The service was prompt  ambiance was OK but a bit too crowded for my taste - you will hear other tables conversations so not the most intimate romantic spot. I'm more inclined to go back to visit the bar but wouldn't hesitate to order a full meal if the mood strikes.   peace  love  and good booze ~ chase http://goodbooze.tumblr.com/post/5950447011,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1

Everything my friends and I have ever tried has been delicious. We have not been disappointed whether it be an appetizer  main course  or dessert.  The atmosphere is swanky  sophisticated  yet always friendly and not pretentious. We tend to eat dinner late and have never been hurried even as the last diners left.  I disagree that it is overpriced."" It is a more upscale dining experience but definitely on par with other restaurants of this caliber in terms of pricing. The only difference is that Blue has better tasting food.   I'm vegetarian and they have an entirely separate vegetarian menu!!! That made me love the place instantaneously as most fine dining restaurants don't care about vegetarians. Order the fresh sauteed vegetables. It comes with a perfectly cooked assortment of unique fresh vegetables in the most divine  creamy  white wine sauce you'll ever taste. It doesn't sound like anything special (just veggies) but it is a complete and delicious meal. They happened to be serving a butternut squash risotto side dish one night that I ordered separately but complimented it perfectly.  My fiance orders the gruyere tart appetizer pretty much every time. He had the halibut the first AND second time he was here because it was so good.   The food is always made with the freshest ingredients  locally grown whenever possible. It is always brilliantly flavored  spiced  and sauced...never bland. And they have a very diverse menu. You will not be disappointed if you decide to treat yourself for a night!""",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
_VVitWVj4AvzqV91O6c1Mw,kNv1Y8G51h3EsCpE0rDfYw,1,3,2/13/2010,I'll always know this place as Intermezzo.  Sadly  I don't think it's as good as it used to be.  Sure  the portions are the same (i.e. HUGE) but I feel like the veggies aren't as fresh whenever I go.  Maybe I'm just unlucky?  Also  I think they might have changed the recipe for my favorite dressing (Herbal Vinaigrette).  Not sure what it is  but something doesn't taste the same.  It's still a cozy place to eat but it gets pretty crowded  so I usually take it to go.  This place isn't the cleanest joint in Berkeley so if that bothers you  I'd go to Smart Alec's for your salad fix.  Personally  it's not a problem.  I still go back every once in a while when I'm jonesing for some greens (the legal  nutritious kind)  but I've been disappointed the last few times.

Fortunately at 5pm there was no line  so up I went and ordered. Love love love their honey wheat bread. Their salad  even in the to-go box was huge that we had a hard time finishing it. Love the poppyseed dressing and their sliver of a pineapple. I also ordered their eggplant sandwich  and it still tasted good after driving back home to SF.

Great prices  large portions  delicious bread on the side of the salads. Their most popular  and in my opinion  best dressing is the poppyseed dressing. During lunch hours its pretty hard to find seating. You order in a way that reminds me of a school cafeteria line and you clean up after yourself (or you could leave it for the bus boys to come around... eventually. But you can't really because sometimes they're so packed that people are standing around waiting for a seat).   If i had to pick between the sandwiches or salads.. I'd go with salad just cause it's that good.  It's always so fresh  love the ingredient options  and I never leave feeling guilty. I always walk out feeling fulfilled and healthy.

I always order their chef salad  which is their most complicated salad.

Some people say it's changed and I do think they skimp on the meat now (although they still give you a lot in your sandwiches...it just used to be even more than that) and use grape tomatoes instead of sliced roma tomatoes  it's still the same ol' place that has delicious salads and sandwiches.    I love love LOVE the honey wheat bread.  I can eat that all day long.  I heard before  you could get a bag full of the bread ends for a quarter or so  but I'm not sure if they still do that.  I usually get the BLTA  which is a BLT with AVOCADO.  The bacon is always crispy and never oily  which is amazing considering they make the sandwich as I'm walking through the line.  The salads are huge so get the dressing on the side (poppy seed is great) so you can save some of the salad for later.  They sometimes skimp on the salad but most of the time  they fill the bowl or plastic to go container up to the brim with spring mix  sprouts  cucumbers  tomatoes and croutons!  I love how it also comes with a slice of pineapple sometimes  which is a perfect way to end the meal.    There is usually a very long line  but it moves quickly.  The workers are a bit unfriendly sometimes  in both their appearance and attitude.  However  the food is always good and they move through the line quickly so I don't want to complain.

GET THE SALAD!! plus  the salad comes with a huge chunk of their store-made honey wheat bread and pineapple  yum.  also  try their strawberry lemonade. its amazingly tasty!

No less an authority than Weekly food critic Jonathan Gold claimed this was some of the finest Okonomiyaki in LA  so when the truck was in my area  I had to pay a visit.  What is Okonomiyaki? I lived in Japan for 6 months many years ago and never came across it. Basically it is a savory pancake or griddle cake often made for festive occasions. People sometimes refer to it as Japanese pizza because of the general flat shape and because you can select a wide variety of ingredients to go in and on your Okonomiyaki.  Basically  you first choose an essential meat ingredient. I'm told that shrimp and pork are the traditional choices  but I also had the salmon  which was very good. The shrimp was still better. For accents  I usually go with more Asian ingredients like scallions  ginger  kimchi  and bonito flakes. You can also get more creative and go with options like bacon and provolone. A Japanese mayo and special soy-based sauce are drizzled on top.  The end result is a good-sized tasty meal. Definitely a good value for the money and you won't find something of this quality anywhere else.  They also have Teppan-yaki skewers with rice and salad  which are also available in half orders (and are still pretty big).  The staff are friendly and helpful  the truck is clean and the kitchen professionally run. Your food is served in a high-quality reusable plastic container (complete with a fortune"" on the personalized label). Everything about this truck says quality.

As hard as I tried  I just couldn't come up with a Haiku for how delicious and great this food truck is.   Glow fish is not your typical Japanese food truck. You've already accepted the fact that you can get good sushi off the side of the truck with Fish Lips and the other sushi joints. Glow fish on the other hand explores some Japanese deliciousness in the form of griddle cakes.   I'm not white so I don't typically crave mayo  but for some reason tasting the mayo laced on this Okonomiyaki made me crave more of it like a vampire in a blood bank. Now you may be confused on what a bespoken essential is  but don't worry  it's just the protein that you're going to have with this griddle cake.   It's original.. well  I guess not really original if you're from the land of the rising sun. Then this would just be considered a typical meal. Much like how in China they don't call it Chinese food.  But you get my point that this is fairly original for the sake of getting something like this off the side of a food truck. No matter how fusion crazy the trucks are getting these days  this is still something to be tried and enjoyed at all cost.

The falafel balls could definitely improve in texture and taste and their lemonade  lemonade/ice tea does not taste good...but still.   For southside  I give it a 5 for their unlimited salad bar and good prices.

I walked in around 10:30pm on a Sunday night and ordered a Maoz falafel  a homemade Arnold Palmer and their sweet potato fries. I think everything came out to around $8 or so. It was the end of the night right before they were closing  but everything in the salad bar was still full and looking/tasting fresh. The manager welcomed me to dine in even though they were closing at 11pm and even gave out extra fries because they were throwing them out at the end of the night already. I told him I had been to the Maoz in Philadelphia and oddly enough he too was from the east coast and I scored two coupons for a $5 meal deal and %10 off. I left stuffed  with extra fries  and with every intention of coming back.   So the short run down: go here whether or not you're a vegan because it is tasty!! I saw one reviewer who complained that there wasn't a meat option... i'm sorry you're an idiot if you're going to complain that a VEGETARIAN place has no meat in it. Try the fried broccoli and cauliflower  and the garlic sauce.

I probably eat here about once a week  and it's always so delicious. Being 6 blocks from a grocery store  it's easy to not get in the FDA's recommended servings of fruit and vegetables  but with Maoz  it's never a problem.   I started out getting a classic pita- stuffed with falafel balls  hummus  and baba ghanougsh  but now I get a pita with either avocado or feta cheese- it cuts down on the price a bit  and leaves more room for the tasty veggie delights on the salad bar. It's a win-win! Also  I love that you can revisit the salad bar as often as you like. I stuff my pita as much as I can  and about halfway through  I go back and pile on more veggies! My favorites are the roasted red pepper  chickpeas  and the roasted beets.   I'm also a big fan of sweet potato fries. While Maoz' isn't the best source for these in the world  they're not the worst either. Just the same  the pita is so filling  I don't order the sweet potato fries unless I'm REALLY hungry.

I feel like you're basically eating a salad in a pita wrap. My first time  I tried the junior falafel sandwich  which wasn't bad. You get to pick your own toppings and sauce  and the falafels are good. I see people go up and add more toppings as they eat  so you're getting a little more for your money. It's pretty filling as by the time I finished  I didn't want my sweet potato fries anymore. The food is good  but I don't find it that special.

17PRKve78GgzlHYdEbK7TQ,RZDqlE_z2vc1-7Wl8yM0Qw,1,5,8/24/2011,I was skeptical about this place - if you just pop your head in  it looks like a tiny salad bar with not much else going for it. But I finally came in for the falafel sandwich meal (thank you Munch on Me)  and it was nothing short of a culinary revelation. seriously.  Their belgian fries were literally the best fries I've had in my entire life  and I'm willing to stake my (admittedly paltry) reviewing reputation on that. They were crunchy and golden on the outside  softer on the inside  and the perfect size for dipping. They don't even need salt!   I've never been a huge fan of falafel  but theirs were incredible. Like the fries  they were crisp on the outside and moist on the inside  and so full of flavor! Totally unlike any other falafel I've ever had. The rest of the sandwich wasn't overshadowed  either - the pita was the perfect medium softness  the hummus was well seasoned  and you basically can't go wrong with the salad bar toppings. Tahini sauce  cilantro sauce  whatever. It's delicious.

17PRKve78GgzlHYdEbK7TQ,oPdF8DOdR-rLTwwPxE8TAA,2,5,5/23/2011,As a bona fide carnivore  I was surprised that I had lunch at Maoz since it's 100% vegetarian. They totally had me hooked when they gave me a sample of their tasty falafels...  ATMOSPHERE It is a very eccentric place that seems overly clean (a lot of chrome)  but it's juxtaposed with tiled walls that feature odd  lime green geometric shapes. It also is pretty high tech. The menus are digital!  The seating isn't too limited but it's a little strange because they have long wooden benches (imagine Ikea-type furniture) and some smaller square tables. The entrance literally leads you up a ramp to the main salad bar. Like I said  a little eccentric.  The workers seem friendly and enthusiastic  but the lady who worked at the cashier when I went seemed like she was in her own world. It took me a few moments to realize that she was waiting for me to place my order.  FOOD After reading other Yelp reviews  I decided to go with the JUNIOR MAOZ MEAL DEAL and let me tell you  it was WAY more than enough. I normally devour my entire meal  but I couldn't finish this meal and left a few fries out on the table  along with some pieces of pita.  The JR MAOZ DEAL comes with a Maoz pita sandwich (lettuce and falafel)  fries  and a drink.  After you pay for your meal  you can grab any DRINK from the display case. You can choose between: lemonade  iced tea  or an Arnold Palmer. For $1 extra  you can get fresh squeezed carrot juice.  As others said  you have UNLIMITED ACCESS to the SALAD BAR  which is probably the best part about Maoz. I was blown away by all the salad/topping choices. Everything was very fresh; the veggies were crisp and juicy and everything was well stocked.  I also enjoyed the variety of sauces at the end of the salad bar  including Tahini sauce  yogurt sauce  and my favorite: GARLIC SAUCE. I slathered my sandwich in these sauces.   The FRIES were good (I got the mixed ones: half sweet potato and half Belgium fries)  but not out of this world. They were crispy enough and tasted great with the garlic sauce.  But really  this place gets 5 stars because they have THE BEST. FALAFELS. EVER. They are PERFECTLY fried and crispy and the flavors are just right. I love all the spices and how healthy everything tastes.  The portions are generous and you can expect to walk out of there feeling very satisfied and full-- and all for under $8?! It even gets an extra point for being so close to campus. If I were vegetarian  Maoz would be my mecca.,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
17PRKve78GgzlHYdEbK7TQ,jUSHkY--mHJRDFwMKoVEzw,1,3,2/24/2011,"I agree with Pook M. that Maoz does not really want you to eat an unlimited"" amount of falafel toppings.  I thought when Pook said  ""They make every effort to prevent you from getting more than a single piece of any one topping"" was so true!! And ""If they really don't want people to truly help themselves to the vegetables  they should get rid of the salad bar model all together.  Awkwardly asking people to not do something after they've already started  and have had no indication to serve themselves any other way  is just ridiculous and incredibly rude.  Plus  if you're paying between $5-8 for 2-4 tiny balls of falafel  half of or one single pita  and questionably fresh lettuce  it's not unreasonable to expect a bit in way of embellishments.""  Great food  but I have mixed emotions regarding the falafel topping bar part of the business and don't understand why they're so stingy.  Boo!""",0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0

There are fallafel sandwiches and salads that are pretty much made to order. You take your blank slate sandwich or salad and customize it at their unlimited fresh veggie bar. Here you will find everything from sun dried tomatoes  pickled peppers and cous cous.   On the meal deal it is worth it to upgrade to the sweet potato fries. Try them with the garlic sauce!  One trap to make sure not to fall into is thinking that because you are eating veggie that you are eating healthy. A lot of the items are fried and a lot of the sauces are mayo based.  Nonetheless this place is delicious so enjoy!,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0

You get either a pita falafel sandwich or a falafel salad and you pick whatever you want from the salad bar"" to put on your sandwich or salad including a number of sauces.  You can also get fries and a drink in combo form.  In addition you can add on hummus  eggplant  feta  avocado  babaganoush or hard boiled egg.  Coming from the Detroit area  I know good falafel.  I haven't had good falafel since moving to California  but Maoz has the stuff.  It's crispy  flavorful but not dry or greasy.  It was perfect.  The salad bar had everything I could want on a sandwich.  The fries were served in a cone  Belgian style (not French or Freedom style).    The inside was modern and austere.  There were a few tables but it's not a big joint.  I imagine this is more a grab-n-go lunch spot.   The only negative was that it was a bit of a wait for the sandwich to come out.

Sorry meat eaters and veggie haters  this place is not for you  but it will definitely challenge your beliefs!  $4.50 for pita with salad or $4.95 for pita with around three falafels  AND you get to fill it up with carrots  coleslaw  broccoli  cauliflower  red beets  along with various other vegetables. If you stay and eat there  you can go back for MORE as many times as you want. It's like a vegetarian buffet!  And they sell sweet potato fries. Mmmmm.  Although if you eat there everyday  you'll probably get tired of the small selection... and during busy hours around lunch time  it might take a while to get your food  But yum yum yum!

We were drawn to it because of the beautiful green tile interior...the colors were so inviting  cool  and peaceful! When we saw that it was a vegetarian restaurant  we had to investigate further. We met James  the shift manager  and he was so friendly and informative and really took the time to explain the history of Maoz and the menu items even though it was closing time. He was really an amazing advocate for this great new restaurant!   The falafel salad bar looked delicious! Beets  tabouli  pickled cabbage  broccoli and cabbage  etc  A really nice selection! As I mentioned before  we were stuffed to the gills but still found room to sample their sweet potato fries and they were DAMN good! I'm really looking forward to coming back to try out all the other menu items. It's almost entirely vegan save for the hard-boiled eggs  some sauces with cream  and the cole slaw. But cole slaw  to me  is a repulsive monstrosity puked forth from the rancid bellies of the hounds of hell so I just pretended I didn't see it. *shudder* So  if you're a vegan  you can get a healthy  delicious  quick and affordable meal  too. And being vegan  you have enough sense to not eat cole slaw anyway  so you're good to go.   I'm so happy to see Maoz in the neighborhood. A VERY welcome addition! The menu is still in my purse and I'm sure I'll look at it longingly a few more times before my next visit.,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
17PRKve78GgzlHYdEbK7TQ,LxBapgNJ6JGI40K4migkTA,3,4,4/19/2010,(This probably even a five-star falafel joint for Berkeley's standards  but there were some very minor kinks and one verrrry bad taste in my mouth at one point. See below.)  How far would you travel for great pitas? Apparently Maoz will go to New York for theirs. And judging from the fluffy  crater-y discs that they're stocked up with  I'd say the trip is worth it.  Of all the chains in all the world that showed up in Berkeley  Maoz had to be it. I'm surprised by the addition but very pleasantly so  and I hope Maoz has a home in Berkeley for years to come  with their fresh  delicious and affordable food. Their operations are really like Falafel for Dummies (the posters explain their business philosophy  the atmosphere hypes up the health benefits and trendiness of falafel  and the employee makes sure to fill in any of the gaps in between).  A five-dollar falafel never did taste so filling  though. And it was pretty darn tasty  too. The regular sandwich comes with five falafel balls in a  pita  with some lettuce that's always welcome but does kind of take away the space for all those other toppings. The pita is so thick it almost looks like a giant  flattened English muffin  and the balls are crispy. I personally detected a very slight metallic aftertaste to the balls-- can't quite pinpoint the herb that caused this-- but no one else had any problem  so it might have just been in my head. The complimentary salad bar is stocked with options upon options; today they had pickles  olives  chickpea salad  cole slaw  shaved fennel  carrot salad  Israeli salad  cabbage and an interesting rendition of tabouleh that I'd previously never seen  among the stuff I can remember. Not to mention a myriad sauces and other condiments. It's kind of a doozy and you may be overwhelmed at the thought of having to pile on everything at once  but they encourage that you come back over and over to replenish.  Though lacking in acidity  this falafel is the best in Berkeley.. at least  that I know of. And it's cheap! And  oh  the pitas. To the end of the meal  the bottom did not yield. I have NEVER finished a falafel (unless it was in lavash) without the bottom tearing on me. O.  who is Israeli  was so surprised and delighted by the likeness of these pitas to those at home; it brought a tear to my soul to see such happiness.   A little tip: unless you're addicted to hummus  don't get it for an extra 50 cents. Not only is it just strange that they would charge extra for that  you won't really be tasting it in the end  anyway  what with all of the toppings to experiment with. And get the fries-- they're extremely delicious and crispy and salty-- though these provided the only unpleasant moment of my lunch. I put a little piece of errant potato skin in my mouth that tasted exactly what manure smells like. It was disgusting  and I promptly filled my mouth with falafel to drown out the taste. I know that sounds foul  but the fries are actually delightful.  I'm all for local  sustainable food but if Maoz has to go all the way to New York for the bomb pitas that are unlike anything else you'll have in the area (seriously  people  how hard is it to make a strong  thick pita? The Israelis have been doing it forever  apparently)  I'm not going to be able to say anything past the mouthful of falafel I'll have.,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0

So there's a variety of toppings  but my favorite ones were baked broccoli/cauliflower  tomato with onions  cilantro dip  chick peas  pickles  and their yogurt sauce. (There are a ton more toppings but those were just the ones that I was interested in) The really really cool thing is that once you are done eating your toppings  you can go back for MORE toppings! It's almost like a buffet!! So as long as you still have some sandwich left  you can get more toppings! It's pretty cool...and with the amount that I ate  I'm really surprised that they made any money off of me...haha!  The actual falafel sandwich was pretty good too! The falafels were not too dry and it had a good consistency. I ordered it with wheat pita and the wheat was still soft and tasty. I'm pretty satisfied with the sandwich overall. The only reason that I gave it 4 stars is because it was good but NOT the BEST thing I've ever had. But it's seriously REALLY close to 5 stars...REALLY CLOSE!    Service: You order at the counter  get your sandwich and then it's a self serve salad bar thing. So not much service  but the guy at the counter was super friendly and nice! He even said Thank you"" when we left and most SERVICED places don't even do that! :)   Ambiance:  It's got nice music playing  I've totally got to give them credit for that! It's new so it's cleaner and very modern looking interior. It looks like it's geared towards the younger undergrad crowd which makes sense  because we are at Berkeley! It's not very crowded or popular  so there aren't that many people there  so I feel like I could just buy a sandwich  sit there indefinitely to study and keep refilling toppings and be set and fed the whole day.....but that's just the cheap  frugal grad student me scheming to take advantage of the system. haha.   Price:  It's pretty cheap  sandwich was under $5 and considering how many times I went back to refill my toppings  I think I really ate like $20 worth of food!  Overall: I'm definitely going back!

I suppose the quality of their dishes depended on which cook was working  which is quite common with a lot of Asian restaurants. All in all  it's a decent restaurant with the ability to be great at times.,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

SOME of their stuff is decent (Fish ball noodles  Monogolian beef) and some of their stuff is REALLY good (HK porridge with preserved duck egg  $5.75)...but I can't get over their lacklustre pho.  You should know that pho holds a very special place in my heart and so when a restaurant butchers it  I get angry. Their pho is hardly pho...AND it's pricey ($7.75??!?!) AND  on top of that  you have to pay extra if you want ANY meat in it. And if you order beef  you won't get perfectly thin layers of rare beef  you'll get some shrivelled strand of tough cow meat. In short: it blows. And I've never tried for myself but my roommate tells me their pad thai is also something to complain about. And pad thai is another thing I hold close to my heart!  But I still visit this place every so often  just to get my fix of thousand-year egg (and the fact that the porridge is Hong Kong"" porridge makes me smile a little. They actually acknowledge us in Westwood?? SWEET!) but to be absolutely honest  I'd go to Noodle Planet instead (that is  if I don't want to venute beyond Wilshire  where there are a LOT of better choices still).""",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
1c4j2NhUZsfA0gt6B6_cBA,ebXeSVhBMl3cYVTerMlOsA,1,3,6/10/2008,Being a vegetarian  there aren't many options when you go out to eat at a restaurant.  With that being said  it was nice when the menu presented everything WITHOUT the meat  which means I didn't have to sound picky and ask whether an item was vegetarian or not.  Adding on chicken  beef  pork  or tofu would cost a $1 extra or something  though.  I got myself Pad Kee Mau (House Special Noodle) with tofu for the price of $8.25 as well as Thai Tea which I believe was $1.95.  The portions were so huge for me that I had to take at least half of it home with me.  Pad Kee Mau had tomato  onions  bell peppers  chiles  and mint leaves mixed with flat rice noodles fried up.  Loved the spice. Love the taste.  Thai Tea was good too. Nothing too extraordinary  but good nonetheless.  So it was all pretty damn good ... until I found a small piece of meat on the plate  For me  that wasn't that big of deal because all I really had to do was take a different fork and scoop it out  but at the same time  it made me pretty unhappy.

1c4j2NhUZsfA0gt6B6_cBA,GhSaMXqqAeOBn5bMIp2ouA,1,2,12/23/2007,"This is a story about Mr. Noodle and Mr. Roach.   Mr. Noodle was serving some yummy pad kee mow and beef panang fried rice to two lovely  agreeable people on a cold rainy weeknight. When all of a sudden  Mr. Roach came crawling up the wall and onto the table of the lovely agreeable patrons! The lovely and agreeable patrons quickly moved their food to the next table and alerted Mr. Waiter. Mr. Waiter stood dumbly for a second (understandable since it's an awkward situation) but then tried to corral Mr. Roach with his bare hands  freaking one of the patrons out. But then he grabbed one of the napkins on the table. By then Mr. Roach had disappeared under the table. Mr. Waiter gave a nervous chuckle and said  It vanished!"" And then something about it being a ghost or something. And the two lovely and agreeable patrons were shocked! but continued their meal at another table. Which they had to move to themselves.  Okay I'm tired of narrating like that. Anyways  what do you do when the waiter pretends that if you don't see it  it's not there? Well I've been in LA long enough to know that restaurants have roaches. And sometimes they come out. And sometimes you see them crawling on an A rating sign  but you're already done with your meal so why bother complaining (see? this isn't the first time I've seen a roach). But I was shocked! that the waiter didn't do more to smush it. (Sp? Smoosh it?) Well those buggers are hard to smush  but why did he then pretend to not see it? Maybe something got lost in the translation. The dude didn't seem to have a firm grasp of English  other than the menu. And since I was with B  I didn't want to make a big girly deal about it since he's uncomfortable with my high-maintenance dining ways. Although it's arguable in this situation... anyways. So here's the kicker. You ready for it?  The cockroach then crawls back onto the table (the table we had just recently vacated in favor of one slightly further away from the wall). My hero calmly takes his napkin and smushes the cockroach on the table. The waiter comes back  and we tell him there's a smushed cockroach under the crumpled napkin. He proceeds to pick it up  look at the dead cockroach  screw up his face in disgust and then he scurries away to confer with the other waiters. And leaves us to our meal. After we finished (well I picked at my fried rice  partly because of cockroach and partly because of the salt lick of a hot dog I had eaten beforehand at Pauley Pavillion)  the waiter comes back and tells us the meal is on the house. Well he said something more like ""it's on my house"" which was endearing since ""on the house"" is a rather weird idiom. He also says something like he didn't see the cockroach before so he didn't do anything about it (which sounded off to me at the time and then later on I realized he DID see it because he tried to corral it with his hands and in my mind I was thinking  ""don't do that use the napkin!!!). Anyways  he definitely saw the dead version of Mr. Roach. Which is why he comped us. I think that's what he was trying to say. But it's just plain wrong that your patrons have to smush your roaches for you.  Anyways  the food was good. And there are roaches everywhere in LA.   And they did comp our dinner. Hence the two stars  not one. But there's no possible way they're getting anymore than that from me given that B had to kill the cockroach himself before our meal was comped. That's NOT OKAY!""",0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

I wasn't feeling noodle-y  but figured I'd check out the menu that is posted outside.  Hey  they have Panang Beef!  The coconut curry beast in my belly directed me in.  I was seated right away..  around 6:15  weekday..  and checked out the menu again anyway.  Pad See Ew.  It sounded soooo NOT Ew  but too bad I wasn't noodle-y that day.    Panang Beef  but they were cool with me wanting to sub the beef with chicken.    The girls the table next to mine  ordered the Pad See Ew  and I became quite jealous when I saw it in person.  Mounds of wide  flat noodles  covered in a brownish sauce.. and with chicken and veggies intertwined.  I'm getting it next week.  And only $7.50 or so for *that* much food?  They ate it for like 20 minutes and barely dented it.    My Panang Chicken came out.. and it was served so neatly.  The coconut curry in a bowl..  filled with lots of chicken breast pieces  basil leaves  and some sliced red pepper pieces.  A bowl of white rice nearby.  They do not have brown rice  darn it!  They do have fried rice though.    The Panang was very good  but a little too sweet after I got half way through.  But that didn't stop me from eating it all.  I don't think I'd get this dish again  but it wasn't bad.  They just have a great menu that I'd like to explore.  After the Pad See Ew.  I paid $8.50-ish and the portion was satisfying..  not as largely portioned as the pad dishes.    The guy on my other side got the Pad Thai with pork  and looked good  too.  It was a reddish sauce with thin spaghetti-like noodles.  I'm not a Pad Thai expert  or even remotely knowledgeable about it  but it looked different from the Pad Thais I've had.

On a holiday weekend when nothing else is really open (and you just danced for 26 hours at UCLA's Dance Marathon... and Bruin Cafe is not that good)  Mr. Noodle comes to the rescue with its Thai cuisine.  Delivery is really efficient!  They have a website online where you can register and do orders from.

For $7.75 I got the Ratang? Sanag? beef curry. Peanut sauce with curry  thai spices  and coconut milk? Sign me up. I usually shy away from beef  but for some reason I got it. Probably because the boy and I were splitting. Anyway  the curry was friggin not bad. I don't know how to cook Thai...yet  so it was something I was HAPPY to pay for. Love beef? They piled the little dish with like twenty pieces! There wasn't as much curry sauce as I like even! However  I told my boy then and I tell ya'll now  I knew it would be good as leftovers  and yes it was. Toss the leftover curry in a pot  add 1/4 cup water  let it boil until the curry gets hot and the water evaporates  and serve. It made the beef even more tender. Why yes I am a good diner and savior of leftovers  thank you.  I will eat here again.

You barely added any egg and very little pork actually. I know you're an easy stop for UCLA students to pack on those Freshman 15  but you should work on your prices and quality a bit. For the price  I can go to many other small Thai places and get much better food and more of it too. Well  I will remember you fondly for your Thai chicken at least...""",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

They don't let you get noodles uncooked (which is really the only way to get soup noodles to-go; otherwise the noodles are stiff and boxy).  Anyway  I really really really wanted pho and was too lazy / cheap to go to the ATM for Noodle Planet.  So I settled for Mr. Noodle's pho"" and that's when they told me they have to cook the noodles (I don't know whyyyy  it's less work for them to do!).  So then I think they misunderstood what I was trying to ask them and put the noodles in the same container as the broth  which is even worse than cooked separate noodles  because now the noodles soaked up all the broth (not to mention the container was overfilled and scalding hot).  I could have forgiven all of this  but then I got home and realized they gave me NOTHING ELSE - no lime/lemon  no leaves  no bean sprouts - NOTHING!  Basically  I paid almost $10 (TEN DOLLARS FOR PHO!!!!!) for rice noodles soaked in MSG  with 3 pieces of steak and a few chewy  fatty pieces of beef that simply do not belong in Vietnamese pho.  I almost cried.  I'm so poor...$10 is a lot for a broke @$$ student...I could have bought 20 tacos from Jack in the Box with that money.  I was so looking forward to having a nice bowl of faux pho in the comfort of my home and Mr. Noodle ruined everything.  I'm just going to suck it up and go to the ATM for Noodle Planet from now on.

Needless to say  I only come here for take-out when I don't feel like cooking and want some Asian food. Because of the convenience  I'm giving it 3 stars.  As I'm eating my Garlic & Pepper Beef right now  my taste buds are screaming. Restaurant food is salty in general  but how salty can it get?? Every piece of the beef has to be eaten simultaneously with a big spoonful of white rice  and preferably two big gulps of water  otherwise your tongue might just kill you. Well  good thing it came with a big mound of rice! The cabbage and broccoli (which also came with my order)  on the other hand  are very bland. But I'm not complainin' because after the beef I much rather have bland than seasoned veggies.  I've also tried their Pad Thai  and Hong Kong Gravy Chicken  and they're ok. The restaurant truly offers a smogasboard of Asian food: Thai  Chinese  Japanese  Vietnamese... It reminds me of those restaurants that serve sushi  steak  and seafood all in one place  except this is the Asian version. The point is  when they try to offer everything  nothing is really exceptional!  Lastly  I asked if I can use my credit card  but they said only for orders over $10. However  just as I gave them cash  the person beside me signed a credit card tab of $8.47. That's really annoying.  On the bright side  if you call and order to pick up  they can be ready for you usually in 10 minutes.

Its a good place if you want something cheap and fast and probably healthier than your typical hamburger fast food joint.  We opted for the chicken pad Thai compared to the other option of shrimp or beef which came out pretty quickly and was hot and fresh.  Personally I think their pad Thai is better than Noodle Planets'.  We also ordered the Thai tea and panang beef with rice.  The Thai tea was WAY too sweet.  We probably could have made two Thai teas for the price of one by mixing in water so that it wasn't so sweet.  Panang curry is my favorite type of curry and theirs was definitely very flavorful as well  but their beef was a little on the tough side.

The dishes here are not mouth-watering over-the-top delicious  but are still tasty and authentic. Mr. Noodle serves all the typical Thai dishes  including a variety of Noodle Soups  Pan Fried Noodles  and Rice Dishes. The portions are generous and the prices are reasonable given that the restaurant is in Westwood. Personally  my favourite dishes include the Pad Thai  Pad See Ew  and Pineapple Fried Rice. For most of the dishes  you can choose the type meat you want: tofu (vegetarian option)  chicken  beef  pork  shrimp (+$1)  seafood (+$2)  combination ($1). Unfortunately  however  The meat is slightly dry and needs more flavor.   I have ordered a few rice dishes from the All Day Special Menu but I found them to be oversaturated with sauce and too heavy for my taste. If you fancy strong flavours and heavy sauces  however  then the All Day Special is a good choice for you. Items on this part of the menu are cheap and are served with rice  soup  and eggroll.   For the most part  the service at Mr. Noodle is okay  though it can be questionable and shaky at times. During busy hours  the wait is quite frustrating. This place delivers  but be warned- deliveries usually take up to 45 minutes to arrive even if you life 5 minutes away from the restaurant! So if you want delivery  make sure you call early!

Flavors are decent  but there are some East Asian flavors that I think are poorly imitated. The combination fried rice  as well as the pad see ew  pad thai are staples  along with some interesting combinations like the pineapple fried rice (which is okay for Westwood) and the teo-chew noodles. I happened to like their pad kee mau for its heat  along with the panang curry fried rice. I think the flavors are quite strong  but the other curries  specifically the yellow and green are surprisingly not that great. Really not worth the price  but welcome to Westwood.

It seemed like a generic little fusion place  we sat at a table on the sidewalk out front. I glanced over the menu and saw a bunch of different types of dishes. I did notice some consistency in the Thai dishes and got the feeling that that might be the safest route. I ended up getting the Green Curry Chicken ($6.50) with brown rice ($1.50)  and the soup of the day and fried spring roll (.50).   the soup was egg drop and a piss poor version at that. It was so bland and flavorless that I really didn't want to eat it  but whatevs. The spring roll was worthless as well for that matter. But for .50  I can't really complain about the inadequate accompaniments. Most importantly  my green curry was very good. They took it real easy on the fish sauce in my opinion  but they weren't shy about the heat. Not that it was Thai spicy or anything  but it actually had heat and not just sweet coconut milk like many other places. The chicken was very good as well and both went nicely with the perfectly cooked brown rice.   My friends orders looked generally less successful. One friend got some kind of a chicken salad that looked pretty generic. Another got some kind of vegetable dish that looked like a bunch of green beans. The other go the Thai fried rice  which actually looked really good. She seemed to enjoy it  which could further support my theory that the Thai dishes are the best bet. The other day  a colleague ordered delivery and she got some kind of sweet and sour fried calamari that smelled great and she loved and a wonton soup that she also raved about and smelled quite good.   I think this place could be decent  but you just have to order right. They are really seem like a true 3 (mediocrity)  but obviously there is some variability around that.,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

Besides the greasy  75% daily sodium intake-containing  fake Asian food we have on campus  Mr. Noodle is the next best thing.  (Forgive me  I haven't tried Noodle Planet yet.)  I remember I really adored the Thai BBQ Chicken when I had it six months ago  but because it was six months ago  I can't say much more.  I LOVE the Pad Thai.  I don't care about authenticity  this stuff is G O O D.  The portion is awesome for the price  the noodles are the right amount of chewy  and everything is just so nicely proportioned!  I adore it.  I don't remember too much about the Garlic & Pepper  and the Pad See Ew was okay.  Tummy aches...  but still okay...  Pad Thai WINS!  Wins wins wins.  Besides their Pad Thai (which I honestly don't know why I love so much)  their food is generally pretty standard.  Yeah  you'll eat it  you'll think it's okay  and that's that.  Nothing too special.  SO  the last experience really ruined it for me.  First of all  I think they stopped refilling special drinks  like their Thai Tea (love) and their Green Tea (kinda love)  which really sucks.  Their menu said they only refill soft drinks now  or did I just totally disregard that the other times I refilled my Thai Tea over and over again?  Someone give me the dibs on this.  OKAY  besides that new little side note they added to their menu  my friends and I concluded that the women there are bitches.  The waiters are great at Mr. Noodle!  They take our order patiently  they tend our needs and empty cups patiently  they wait for us to pay patiently.  THE WAITRESSES?  Totally different story!  The waitress we had last time rushed our order  misheard my friend's order thus gave her the wrong order  argued that she indeed heard #43 not #45  then rudely snatched the bowl of soup off the table to the kitchen.  When she comes back  she plops it right on the table  and oh HEEEEEEEEY  it's a bug!  Okay lady  let us try to get your attention.  There's a bug in my soup."" ""WHAT?"" ""There's a.. okay  nevermind."" And then she storms away.  WELL GEEZ.  Conclusively and quick to the point: 1) No refills on special drinks anymore. 2) Wrong order 3) then tried to blame it on us. 4) Wsup lil' black thing with a ton of legs? Hey  look. 5) ""What do you want now?"" tone and expression.  If their Pad Thai wasn't so good  I would 2 star them.  But I'm a really nice person.

This place always called my attention as i like asian food and i always see it around.   So when i finally got a chance to try it i was expecting this place to blow me away. I had a seven sea soup and my gf had a noodle thai noodle dish that i can't recall.  My soup was ok  and the best highlight of it was that the seafood didn't require and work such as peeling. The only thing that i thought was really awesome about this place was that they had refills on thier thai iced tea. THAT ROCKS!!

After all  how am I supposed to begin a review for a restaurant I've had more often than my own mother's cooking? Alas  I must try.  When I think of you (and I think of you often)  I think three words: house special noodles. (I just got chills).   HOUSE SPECIAL NOODLES: The first time I tried your House Special Noodles (with beef of course)  I nearly swooned. I mean really. It was that good. These wide rice noodles tossed with basil leaves  cilantro  tomatoes  and spices were truly mouth-watering. But  in all honesty  I wish you were a little more consistent. Some days  it's right on the money. That's when I thank God to have a surrogate father like you.  GARLIC BABY SPARERIBS: Pan-seared to perfection  when you make these chunks of pork just right  they are so tasty I wish I had bought 2 orders. The roasted chopped garlic bits are really yummy as well.  FREE DRINKS WITH PURCHASE OVER $10: You always get me with this part Mr. Noodle. I mean  how can I pass up a free thai-iced tea or cup of ice cold coke? You win. I win. We all win.  In conclusion  what I want to say is this:  ====================================================== Recommended dishes: house special noodles with beef::garlic baby spare ribs::japanese curry (careful  it's got a kick).  Bonus points: fast delivery; free drink with delivery of $10+.  Minus points: food quality always good  but not always great (but when it is...oh boy)  In short: I love this place!!!,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0

All i ordered was a small seafood hot and sour soup that was really small (smaller than the container my roomate got and she ordered the same thing a couple hours earlier!) and a boba green tea drink totalling $11.09 + a dollar tip. call it what you want  i call it  a shitty  deal..   the liquid soup was good and so were most of the ingredients except for one muscle/or clam that f***ing had some half-digested sea sprouts inside the 'lips'. i dont mind eating clams  muscles or oysters at all but this lil guy caught my eye. so Im thinking -oh its probably a 'stuffing'  but another clam didn't have it so I investigated further by opening up the clam's 'lips' and I tried to pull out the sprouts and it was attached to the inside! as if the clam was in the process of digesting it still. and then I opened it more and there definitely was a bunch of clam feces still inside  black mushy clam dooky      i took a picture and tried to post in on here  kept saying the upload was unsuccessful though.,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Maybe it was because we didn't get any noodle dishes  as it seems that they screw those up pretty badly?  Was looking for a place nearby my girlfriends new place to eat a late dinner. I was feeling anything Asian  so one quick consult on Yelp and here we were. It looked pretty standard for a campus restaurant with cheap decor and functional service. It reminded me sort of Thai Noodle in Berkeley.  Tried their pineapple fried rice and a beef curry I don't remember the name of. The pineapple fried rice was decent  nothing amazing. They put imitation crab in  which I'm normally OK with  although I've never seen that before. Giving it some thought now  it needlessly complicates the flavor of the dish by adding a foreign artificial seafood flavor to a fairly sweet flavored dish. The beef curry dish was much better. They actually give a buttload of beef cubes in it  which is nice. In fact  the dish is pretty much a giant pile of beef with a savory  sweet  and spicy curry. We ordered it a la carte so it would be easy to take home and reheat the leftovers.  Both dishes reheated well the next day as well. I would give the pineapple fried rice a bit under 3 and the curry a bit over. I wasn't blown away by the experience (and my friends all recommended Noodle Planet  which for some strange reason has a worse rating?) but based on our rice and curry experience  Mr. Noodle definitely lands in the 3 star zone.,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0

Although it can often be crowded  we've never had trouble getting a table for 4.  There are a few very small tables outside  but you'd be sitting right on a busy sidewalk. As other reviewers have mentioned  the tables inside are too close  but it's not unbearable.  A mirror covering one wall helps to make this small place seem larger.  Prices are good and service is always friendly and fast - they offer to refill your drinks and don't rush you out  even when they are busy.  The pad see ew is one of our favorites - the chicken is better than the beef  which seems to have a very slight bitter or burned flavor. We recently tried the combination chow mein  and found this to be really good too.  You can get the all day special"" with your entree which gives you an egg roll and soup for only $1.50 more - you can ask for this special on all entrees  not just the ones indicated on the menu..  Teriyaki Chicken is good - and a good choice for kids as there is no separate kid's menu.  The food presentation is nice.  Parking is difficult  but if you if you get tired of looking for an open parking meter spot  after 6pm  you can always park in one of the nearby lots for $3-$5 for the evening.

That age-old Bruin dilemma (often determined by walking distance or location upon realization of noodle craving).   The food at Mr. Noodle isn't *really* up to a usual 4-star rating from me  but I take things into context:  [+] Mr. Noodle delivers  and they deliver fast. The pad see-ew is amazing  it's my favorite dish  and I think they do it well there. Fried rice dishes and other noodles are tasty too. Never wait very long  even if you come in person. Mr. Noodle is super greasy.  [-] Chicken in any number of dishes (fried rice  noodles) has the tendency to come out dry  so I usually opted for tofu or beef.  It's not really great service when you go in person. Too hectic in there. Mr. Noodle is super greasy.  I think majority of the time I've had Mr. Noodle  it's been via delivery. They are also an absolute godsend on those days (like during Finals week) when you get home and you realize you are starving but too tired too cook-- they come so fast!

MUCH MUCH bigger plates.    they still give the crispy fried noodle with your soup  and within 5 - 10 min  your food comes out.  bill came out fast  and we were out of there in less than a 45 min.  perfect for the on-the-run meal for less than $20 for 2 people.  and that was including thai iced tea  which is a must have sugary drink to wash all the food down with.  wow  this might have been the most straight forward  boring review i've ever given.  i should get negative funnies for this one.,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1

Something totally great  for 50 cents more  they add a veggie eggroll and the soup of the day. Eggdrop soup tasted more like hot and sour soup  but it wasn't bad  pretty tasty with a small kick!

The main entrees cost around $8-9 which is pretty reasonable.  It's not the best food in LA for sure...but it's decently priced  friendly service and is pretty tasty. I love the ground chicken with mint leaves  it comes with loads of red bell peppers and is pretty tasty. Their green curry and the beef Penang are pretty good too. I wouldn't drive all the way to eat this food but when I am in Westwood and looking for some good  decently priced food  this is good choice.   If you like your food spicy  then tell them to make it hot as otherwise the food is not spicy (dont trust the menu when they say some dishes are spicy).  There is street parking and if that's full  head to the lot on gayley. It's the best parking option in this area.

Then I remember that it wasn't the Mr. Noodle dish that was so delicious  but the Noodle Planet version. The food is often wrapped or bedded on a piece of aluminum foil which is not only wasteful  but makes the meal look cheesy. I do enjoy their salads though.

1CBs84C-a-cuA3vncXVSAw,VR3s1DGYof2xVtVcoFQqGg,1,5,3/16/2009,"There are a ton of things to like about La Val's Northside  making it hard for me to decide how to start off the review. I've eaten here MANY times  and I've never come upon anything on the menu that I didn't like. The great thing is that seemingly similar items actually give you vastly different impressions. My problem is that I'm always in the neighborhood  so I eat at the same places very frequently  causing me to branch out into different things on the menu that I wouldn't normally order.  For example  I would never typically get any kind of pizza without meat  but the options at La Val's are actually superb. The days when I walk in and the Slice of the Day is their Margherita (light olive oil  mozzarella  feta cheese  fresh tomato  fresh basil  garlic) definitely give me that funny feeling inside because I love that slice SO MUCH. The Athenian style is also quite good despite the lack of meat. But lately I've been fixated on the plain cheese slice. I swear they must do something different to it because I've never tasted a plain"" cheese slice that tastes so complex. It's like they sprinkle MSG or THC or something else amazing on top  I can't stop eating it. Of course the combo and other meat-tastic slices and pies are good as well.  What I like about the pizza probably comes down to the crust - you can tell they spent a while trying to get the right balance of crispy and sturdy  and I think they nailed it. For total value the ""mini"" pizza is the best way to go  you get a pie about twice the size of a ""personal"" you'd order anywhere else  they toss the dough right in front of you  and you can have whatever you want on it. Plus a free soda. I went through a phase where I had a mini mushroom salami linguica and black olive for lunch about 3 times a week. It's like 6 bucks out the door  which is pretty amazing if you ask me.  The Ceasar salad (with or without chicken) is another favorite (and you get a load of it)  the Greek Salad is also good  and the fruit salad and ""Tiramisu"" (totally inauthentic but delicious nonetheless) are also nice treats though I'd say those two are overpriced  particularly in comparison to the rest of what I usually get for lunch (a huge-ass slice and a soda with refill for three bucks? Sign me up!). The pastas are also good for a change of pace  I like when they have the Penne with meat sauce on special (six bucks for pasta  garlic bread and soda).  Service is about what you'd expect - for the most part quick and efficient  usually friendly. But during lunch this place gets BUSY. So expect to have to wait a few extra minutes to pick up your food. They expect you to stay on top of your number and watch the electronic boards for when it comes up  they pretty much won't call the numbers out  so if you want your slice hot  you kinda have to lurk in the ""lobby"" area. I've had some pretty funny conversations with some of the cashiers they've got  which is nice to show some personality.  There's also a sweet beer selection  though I normally don't take advantage of this because I'm usually eating lunch. I think the beers are like 3 bucks for a pint  which is pretty damn good considering you can get a Boont Amber or a Stella for half the price you'd pay at the Mallard or wherever.  Atmosphere is cool  they usually have semi-indie rock playing on the overheads and ESPN showing on two big-screens in the dining rooms. Again  during lunch the place gets packed but if you can hold off til 1 or 2 in the afternoon you can pretty much have the run of the place. They'll even change the channel if there's something you wanna watch. For nice days there's picnic tables out in the courtyard too.  I live in Albany so I don't get delivery from here that much  but I've talked with the drivers a few times when I was hanging around playing the arcade games  and they seem pretty cool. One guy told me some funny stories that I'd never have thought would really happen about delivering pizza.  All in all I have to say this La Val's exemplifies what a 5-star Yelp review means to me. Good food  plentiful portions  good price  strong and fast service. I imagine I'll continue to eat here for a good long while.""",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1CBs84C-a-cuA3vncXVSAw,UBL4ozqR-HZEB8Q9ZghDEw,3,3,11/20/2009,"I got my first taste of tomato-less pizza at La Val's  and came back very often as a student stuck on Northside for most of my college years. This place has your typical pepperoni and other boring"" slices  as well as special combo ones like veggie  Hawaiian and the Athenian. They are very well made  not too greasy except the pepperoni and cheese options  which often have little puddles of grease in the pepperoni (eww...). The slices are of a good size  bigger than my head  with crunchy chewy crusts and just the right proportions of toppings.  The salad dishes are decent  nothing noteworthy  but you might want to stay away from the pasta. I found them a bit stale and flavorless. The sandwiches are a mixed bag. Ham and cheese is just  well  ham and cheese; you might as well go for the Italian sausage.  So it's a pizza place. Anything to make it stand out from  say  the Southside spots like Blondie's or Fat Slice? Well  there are three arcade games at La Val's (which I rarely see anyone play). A pool table sits under a wall-mounted flat-screen TV  while another TV hangs in the main dining area. La Val's is definitely more of a sit-down place unlike Blondie's and Fat Slice  with its various beers on tap and games playing on TV like baseball or basketball  depending on the season. Of course  beer and games make for a loud place  so if you want someplace more quiet  better get your food to-go and move somewhere else. It can also get very crowded  leaving you with no option but the outside seats  which are not protected from weather.  The service is ok. You order  you wait  you pick your food up. Very straightforward  no hassles. The only complaint I have is that the only way to check the status of your order is by the LED boards in the main dining area and above the pick-up counter. No one calls out your number  and there are a few seats that are poorly positioned to give you a good view of the boards. Read: neck-craning every minute. Ouch.  La Val's is obviously catered towards college students  so if you want something to write home about  or you want to give out-of-town visitors a pizza to remember  head over to Cheeseboard (which I reviewed some time ago). If you're stuck on Northside with a craving for pizza while it's raining buckets outside  well  you don't have much of a choice.  But then La Val's closes at around 10pm (if I remember correctly)  so anytime past that... well  better haul your butt over to Southside.""",0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0

1CBs84C-a-cuA3vncXVSAw,FPIpyIpbT_uuvKlMLwT7KA,3,2,6/21/2011,La Vals is not for the picky or the weak stomach(ed) and here's why..   Since I live on the north side of campus  I often find myself going to La Vals. It is pretty big  has comfortable seating  a big TV  and open till about 10:30ish.  I have always accepted the food as being mediocre and gulped it down without complaining (for the aforementioned reasons). However  the last two times that I have been to La Vals  I have been exceedingly disappointed.  Incident 1  Call and ordered food for take out ( 2 slices of cheese pizza  one tuna melt on sourdough roll). I was informed that it would be ready in 15-30 minutes. Within 15 minutes I was standing in line  waiting for my food.  Needless to say it was not ready in fact  they informed me that they were out of cheese pizza slices altogether.  I am still wondering why they failed to mention this over the phone.   All in all  after waiting for about 30 minutes in La Vals  I came home with a cold tuna melt with tonnes of mayo on it and a seemingly stale cheese pizza.    Incident 2  Went to La Vals and Ordered  Shrimp Alfredo and once again  a slice of cheese pizza and a tuna melt on sourdough roll (some people never learn!)  The pizza slice was stale  the tuna melt was given on wheat bread despite it saying clearly on the receipt that it should be on a sourdough roll and it had a little black insect crawling on it  before eventually disappearing into the deluge of mayo.  Despite the pasta having an inch of oil at the bottom  it was delicious!! Unfortunately  it did not quite agree with my tummy and I had to suffer unnecessary gas  cramps and the cherry on top  diarrhea.  I hope La Vals starts to pay more attention to it's food quality and the health of it's customers.,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0

Yeah  like that.  The white-flour crust foldable slices that drip pepperoni grease out the back. The wax-paper service (almost like the Authentic New York Paper Plate).

La Val's is always rather low except on days when I too am feeling rather depressed. Then La Val's fills the void in my heart in a pinch.  In essence  La Val's is the sort of place I think to go when I want a large piece of grease covered carbs only half a block from my house. It's usually when you're having a bad time with a relationship or work or other aspects in your life. It's days when your dinner would be nothing more than coffee  cigarettes  whiskey and aspirin  but you have decided to be intelligent and substantiate it with something a bit more satisfying. Those are the days that inspire me to go to La Val's.  I found myself at La Val's on Sunday for one of the reasons listed above. I ordered the Hawaiian pizza slice  which weirds me out a bit because it has regular bacon and green peppers as well (and not nearly enough pineapple). They didn't heat up the slice as much as I would have liked and in retrospect  I should have gotten the entirely greasy pepperoni because it is always a safe bet. I also ordered their small garlic cheese bread  which was a large serving but really not good (how you screw up garlic cheese bread  I'm still not quite sure).  The inside is nice. Large TVs  videogames and billiards -- but the service is absolute crap. It's the sort of place I only go for takeout because there are much better places to hang out or watch a game.

Or was it the other way around?  DOESN'T MATTER.  Anyway.  They brought home leftovers and it was literally the best pasta I've had in my life  something with marina sauce.  THE. BEST.    So I went with my buddy Rob to give it a try.  Pretty empty on a Friday night  so I get the feeling it's not exactly a bumpin' college hangout~* but it had a few people studying  a family  and some quiet conversation.  Interesting space.  Very little decorating  but a Pirates of the Caribbean pinball machine  Time Crisis 3  and a pool table.  Staff is relatively friendly  always a plus.  Rob got a slice of pizza-- which was huge-- and a pastrami sandwich  I got the linguini with shrimp  eagerly anticipating more of The Best Pasta I'd Had In My Life... and was sorely disappointed.  Not because the food was bad  but because I had ordered the wrong dish.  Still though  it was amazing-- buttery sauce without being overwhelming  nice shrimp.  Didn't quite get why we needed olives  but hey  whatever works.  The garlic bread it came with was fantastic  though they were both end pieces (say what?!).    Rob wasn't a big fan of his pizza  but he seemed to dig the sandwich well enough.  You'd have to ask him.  Definitely a place you could bring friends to  provided it's not a really crowded night.  There's a plasma TV and plenty of space.  Super affordable food  and it's damn good on top of that.

Unfortunately this spot is hella far from the South Side gourmet ghetto but fear not because your ready-to-go culinary options isn't limited to the vending machines and FSM. What I love about La Val's is mainly the crust/bread. The sauce  cheese  and toppings are okay but I think for cheap pizza (let's face it this is no zachary's) the quality is all about equal at every store (Blondie's  Fat Slice  etc). So it comes down to personal preference. For me  the dough/bread at Blondie's sucks! Its texture is AWFUL. However I love La Val's thin crispy texture. Plus for about 3.25 you get a free small drink with a huge slice. So not only is the lunch super tasty and pretty cheap but they don't try to milk you extra for the soda.

Show up at noon on a weekday and you'll wait 20 minutes just to get a slice of pizza because half of the engineering students on campus are here for lunch -- avoid it at this time if at all possible.  At any other time  La Val's is great. They serve up some quality food. Pizzas are fresh and have thin crust  which I really love (being a New Yorker and all). They have some pretty great topping combos too -- I like that they sort of bridge New York and California pizza styles. Pasta entrees  salads  and sandwiches are all solid too. And portions are _huge_  which is probably why they're a perennial favorite with students. Pay a little  eat a lot.   It's noisy  particularly on big sports game days when they have a big TV showing the game (pizza  beer  and football? Good combo!) and are packed to bursting with hungry fans. There's a pool table and a handful of arcade machines if you want to entertain yourself while waiting for your food.   Last thing: don't miss the theater downstairs. La Val's Subterranean Theater is currently home to Impact Theatre  who produce a nice mix of standards and off-beat new works. They'll let you bring your pizza and beer downstairs to watch the show  which is even better.

The food is reasonably priced (it's cheaper than Blondie's) and the slices are large.  The flavor isn't bad either.  I like the pizza's sauce and its texture.  I'd describe the texture as more thin/crunchy than thick/chewy.   On the whole  the pizza is on the thin side.  (But it's not super thin  like some pizza can get.)  When you bite through it  the top half of the pizza (which contains the dough  cheese  and toppings) is soft; the bottom half (which is the crust) is crunchy.  So  to complete your bite  you have to firmly bite downward at the end.  The other nice thing about this place is that it is quite clean and it has an open feel to it.  This is a nice change from the grimier  darker joints on Telegraph.  On the whole  this is a great place to enjoy some pizza and beer (there are a number of options on tap).,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0

I think they might have a lasagna that I liked too. But as a fair warning  everything is far too oily than it should be.  The set up of this place is like a fast food joint  where you order in line and wait for your order to be called. Well  it is a fast food joint! The place is big and there are lots of tables. You can easily sit around for hours without feeling like you're taking up space for other patrons. Many a times  I've studied here with some friends  but ended up getting pizza grease on all our papers. There are some arcade games and a pool table too. There is also a small playhouse downstairs! Also  there are coupons online  in the Guide to the Good Life coupon book  and the Press Pass discount card.,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

1CBs84C-a-cuA3vncXVSAw,UzAKbe1oYPn1ZbLaF9mE1Q,1,3,7/23/2008,So alright  like mentioned earlier  Italian food is my favorite.    And this one   in terms of the quality for the buck  is A-OK.  La Val's is actually pretty much the same as Gypsy's in that they both cater to the busy and broke college student  but when I'm craving Italian (which is more often than you know)  I'd much rather come here than go to Gypsy's for two reasons: they're much faster and efficient (your food arrives in a timely manner)  plus their garlic bread is tastier than Gypsy's version (essentially bland even as we speak).  However  although they are much better than Gypsy's  this is not to say they aren't faulty on certain things; their setup needs to be further organized for greater efficiency.    Here are my suggestions to La Val's:  1) Please place trays next to the food pick-up window.  I am coming from school with books in my hand  and I cannot possibly carry my books  2 plates of food  and a drink in my two hands.  Nada.  2) Why not have a bussing station so that customers can bus their own tables if you are not going to stay on top of it?  Several times I've come in with my hands full  looking for available tables and shocked to find that dishes and dirty napkins from previous customers have been left sitting there for what seems to be a long time.  3) Your brewed ice tea  although from Lipton  tastes kind of weird.  Please replace with a tastier version.  4) Please place utensils near the food pick-up window because when my hands are full with 2 places of food  a drink  and books  I really don't want to walk over to the other side of the room  and use another hand to get the fork.  Essentially  I'd like to place everything from napkins to utensils onto my plate/tray before heading out to the dining area.  Other than that  I think it's great La Val's has comfy seats  a big-screen TV to accomodate my Obama news  and a pool table.,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1

I didn't really have any standard of quality for the food here but I enjoyed what I got. I will miss Maoz Vegetarian very deeply as I had many memories there but it's gone now.  The grand opening special is the $5 doner wrap (choose from chicken  lamb  beef  or veg). There is also a $7 doner plate special that includes some rice and a side salad. I ordered the combo doner plate (originally $7.50) that included chicken  lamb  and beef. Credit cards are accepted! The layout of the seating isn't the best but it's the exact furniture that Maoz used. Don't be fooled by the existing salad bar"" though as that is only for people who order the salad box and the variety is extremely limited.   The wait for the food was about 5 minutes and the guy who rang us up was remarkably nice and patient  and definitely not pushy. On a side note  I do always see him standing outside when I walk down Telegraph  most likely on a break since he wasn't offering any samples of falafels like Maoz used to do on a regular basis.   The plate was filled but not to the max. I did expect some more rice upon first glimpse. The pieces of chicken  lamb  and beef flattened the small scoop of rice. The salad was spread across about 1/3 of the plate and the leafy greens were pretty good with the vinaigrette and ranch dressings. I normally hate lamb because the texture of the meat isn't what my mouth is used to but I had a more favorable time eating it here as the slices were thinly cut. The chicken was average tasting  although I did add hot sauce to it to kick it up a notch in the flavor department. I didn't really notice the beef  or if I got any beef at all; lamb looks too much like beef. I am still full from the meal as I am typing this review so definitely give it a try but do not have extremely high expectations for a brand new place that is working its kinks out.""",1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1

Got combo dish (chicken+ beef+lamb). Came w the meat  rice and salad. Nothing really stood out but nothing worth complaining about either.

1dS4wRFdtbPRy3tHezpNQg,0NhS1AHxU1GCsDBiZkZ0Og,1,4,4/5/2007,I know this store location hasn't been doing that great.  I think it has changed ownership at least four times since I've been around.  The last store use to be Sumo burger.  Anyways...I can see why they don't get that many customers  but I feel like they should have more.    You can get a chicken teriyaki bowl for $5.17 with tax here.  I think it's a good deal  but I feel like it can be cheaper haha.  It's pretty good.  They give you fresh veggies (carrots and broccoli)  pretty good amount of chicken (most of the fat is taken off)  and a whole lot of rice (I never finish it unless I didn't eat the whole day).  If you want something with more spices then you can get another bowl that has a different sauce called the Thai BBQ.  I also had their burgers which aren't bad.  They also have a happy hour from 3pm to 6pm?   Little snacks for like 2 bucks.  I never  ordered from it.  Sounds like crap.  Fries and hot dog (I rather go to Desi dog) and chicken nuggets and fries (????) UMMM NO!    For the most part they are quick and sweet.  The seating is very comfortable and relaxing and you never have to worry about finding a seat like other places.  Also  close to campus so my feet and stomach are happy.  They have a big screen TV which is a plus in my book.  They always have some movie playing and it's a nice way for me to not worry about studying hahah even though I really don't do that anyways  :x  They have a frequent buyers card too.  So ask them for one  if they don't mention it.  Currently  after you purchase a meal they give you a 15% coupon.  How much better is that?  An extra quarter for you to keep to put towards yopo.

What they do need to do is advertise to get students to come in.   If you provide your Pepsi wristband received at Caltopia  you get a free fountain drink. Insidethegoodlife.com has valuable coupons as well. I used the free drink with 3 entree purchase coupon but will return for the free 3-entree combo with the purchase of a 4-entree combo.   The variety of items is a bit more than Chinese Express a few blocks away. There are even three different types of fried rice to choose from: pork  shrimp  and vegetable! I was really surprised that there was fresh BBQ pork (cha siew) that was very lean  just the way I like it. I didn't try it but opted for the pork fried rice  garlic eggplant  and broccoli beef.  The pork fried rice is good in the sense that the meat is good qualty-the chunks are bite sized real-meat pieces. However  I still prefer the Chinese Express fried rice because it is more flavorful because Chinese Exp uses more soy sauce. The garlic eggplant is something really different. It's on the very greasy side but the garlic taste is subtle. The eggplant is really soft and tender but more garlic flavor like Le Petit Cheval would make it way better. The broccoli beef was better than I expected for a new place. The meat quality is actually good and the broccoli was really fresh.   Upon walking in  it is weird how the steamed food table is facing opposite you and there are no menus or prices anywhere. The only dollar value I saw was the sign that said $.25 for credit card transactions. My total was $5.50 for rice and 2-items which is officially called a 3-item combo. I'll come back when I crave cheap Chinese food.,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
1E2MQLWfwpsId185Fs2gWw,qCGej6yXUdh1n2liLMJlEw,2,4,8/21/2012,This place just opened  and I like it a lot so far - big space with lots of tables  clean  and a ton of selection (of Chinese food  in case you didn't know what country Peking was in)  like 15 dishes or something.  I feel this place fills something Berkeley has lacked for a while  esp. near the dorms - quick  cheap  tasty Chinese food. There were those $1.xx Chinese places dotted around the city  but even back when I was in school (as in last decade)  anything that cost that low  even while accounting for inflation (deflation  since backward??)  was guaranteed to be super-sketch.  But this place is pretty tasty  and fresh! Hopefully it holds up  but for sure I'll be back. I had the shrimp fried rice (that was one thing I'd never seen before - they had THREE types of fried rice  and all looked tasty - take *that* Panda Ex)  spinach with garlic  and the classic salt-pepper-pork-spare-ribs. Also threw in some fried wings for good measure (a Chinese buffet tradition of mine for some reason). All good stuff. And speaking of stuffed  I was really full after too  despite a skipped breakfast.  So  a definite 4 stars for now - because  it's not a sit-down Chinese restaurant  and it doesn't pretend to be  so no fairs comparing it to like Great Wall or China Village - but for pre-prepared Chinese food for quick pickup and consumption  it's dang good. Will post updates after vetting some of the other dishes.,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0

A small takeout-esque ordering area  coupled with an ENORMOUS dining room? Still doesn't make sense to me!  That being said  the food here is cheap. And... cheap. It's your stereotypical Chinese takeout food  so I personally don't find it to be anything special.

Their Indian dishes are fabulous and each comes with lentils  yogurt  this warm bread... really big portions and super satisfying.

1EMNJAZpx5tKT5DkzCtQgw,F0mgNhfMZcCNjWDebSSkPQ,1,4,9/8/2008,My first review on Yelp!   I found this place a month ago from this website. I was in search of a new place I can get lunch at. I work for USC for a few years now and I am burnt out on most of the places within a 5mile radius. I saw that pic of the Breakfast burrito and I there was hope for me yet!  I love indian food but no one in my office does. This place gives me an option of getting indian food because they have burgers  sandwiches  and mexican food as well. So my orders to this place is pretty diverse lol.    Whenever  I try a local spot near work I like to try a couple of items at a time. I have been there four times. This place has been good each time.  So far I had the following items:   Tikki Marsala - 4/5 really good but I am not a expert on indian food :P  Somosa -5/5 it was cooked good. They only have the potato one tho                            no lamb version.  Pupusa - 4/5 Really good  not greesy like some. Cheese was better than the pork one tho.  Sopes - 5/5 pretty big for a sopes and really tasty!   Veggie Breast Burrito - 4/5 Good but they didn't put avacado in both times. :(  Hamburger- 3/5 Good burger but being in LA competition is harsh. The fries that come with it are awesome tho.   Food overall 4/5 - This place is generally not real greesy which is a plus for many ppl. The variety is great and so far each type has been great.  Atmosphere 2/5- is not great  No Air-con so it gets a lil hot in there. Don't get your hopes up  its still a mom n pop place. You won't see a flashy corporate setting. I don't suggest taking a date here but togo orders are recommended.   Service 3/5- is OK. Friendly staff but don't expect much small talk. No orders were ever missing. Really helpful advise if you don't know what to order.      Prices 4/5 - Cheap especially for the quality.   This place has it all! Mexican Food  Indian Food  American Burgers and Sandwiches as well as Coffee  Tea  Deserts and Ice cream :)  I definitely recommend this! Cheap and there is something for every picky friend!,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0
1EMNJAZpx5tKT5DkzCtQgw,B1OJbU9qVfGPtcqdewa5FA,4,5,6/21/2010,When you first walk in you think American  Mexican  and Indian food in one place? Then you get the idea (from the Indian music playing and owner/staff) that Indian fare is their game. But wait! there are some Latino chefs in the back  too  cooking it up! Dunno how the American fits in but your wanton Indo-Mex desires will be satiated here. According to other reviews  the fusion Indo-mex dishes are not to be missed (i.e. Chicken Tikka Burrito). I only tried the Indian food and it was off the hook. An oasis of good eats in the Good-Eats Void that is Hoover/Adams near U$C.  EATEN: Malai kofta: veggie meatball curry. Holy Maha Raja  these meatballs tasted like meat! tender moist and flavorful. Piping hot melted into the curry sauce so nicely as i chewed. Chicken saag: tender chicken and spinach (saag) with a spicy kick to it.  I basically had the best mango lassi ever!! Order it! I will probably come back just for that.  Usually I don't like lentils from Indian restaurants but these were exceptional.  Finally  the SOFT nan was tasty in it's own right  but with the tamarind chutney sauce it became a worthy side dish.  The JOVIAL owner (manager?) gave us a COMPLEMENTARY side of Briani (sp?) Indian fired rice. It was an experimental dish he was trying to customize including onion  ginger  curry powder and a butt load of other Indian spices  according to the generous shop-keep. Is that not awesome? he brought us a dish he was still trying to tweak for free. that is hott.  I'll be back to try a lot of other dishes  at this rate. Most items are $6.99-$7.99.

I used to go here when I lived on 24th St. and tired of the greasiness of Pete's. The menu is long and confusing so you kind of just have to shoot and hope you don't miss. But I would bet on the Indian food  as the staff appear to be Indian  and it is easy to find superior American and Mexican food elsewhere. I usually get the tikka masala which is really good and sort of spicy. Everything (I think) comes with a little rice and naan on the side and is a perfectly large lunch portion. Their coffee isn't bad either. The inside is pretty depressing so if you're eating in  go out the back to the luscious outdoor garden patio.

This is one of its kind restaurant with American  Indian and Mexican food  not to mention Indian-Mexican fusion which is incredibly delicious. And they serve breakfast until they close.  Highly recommended their Chicken Pesto sandwich/ Club sandwich and Texas burger. Indian food combos are really good  especially Chicken Tikka Masala. And everything Indian-Mexican fusion is a must.

It's a terrific place to study.    They have American (burgers  sandwiches)  Mexican (burritos  tacos  quesadillas  etc.)  and Indian food and some of that is a little bit of a fusion"" cuisine.

The fact that there wasn't really salsa/pico de gallo really didn't matter- it tasted amazing....and I truly love my salsa.  They also took the time to cut it in half  which really helps so you don't feel like you need to eat the whole thing before you put it down.  The service was also great  though it wasn't busy.

I'll definitely come back here to try some of their other menu items. I heard their breakfast burritos are really good.""",0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1
1EMNJAZpx5tKT5DkzCtQgw,CXIlc8aaTJWP-okQITFsWA,1,4,2/16/2011,I love Paul and his awesome Indian-Mexican-American food.  Try the breakfast burrito or the tikka masala quesadilla. YUM. Mango lassis are delicious  and offer a nice alternative to coffee (which also happens to be good here).   Free wi-fi  lots of tables  never crowded. Great place to study  work  or meet with friends. I once came in with a group of 8 friends  and Paul treated us so well. He recommended his favorite dishes  and even brought us complimentary Indian sweets for dessert with our check.,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1

1EMNJAZpx5tKT5DkzCtQgw,OYRBIr0yZLKmrXYdd4NHYA,2,3,10/1/2011,Ah.. the good old 23rd street cafe. So many memories from this restaurant. This is the place frequented by all the desi (indian) population in USC. Has valuable and essential indian groceries that we cannot live without. The indian groceries are reasonably priced (well  not all of it  but it's not outrageous) but the regular groceries like milk and juice are expensive. Day-light-robbery I say.   The restaurant here is decent. I haven't had any excellent dishes here.Okay types. In fact  once my friend found a piece of meat in his veggi dish and was totally grossed out.,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
1EMNJAZpx5tKT5DkzCtQgw,d9gmKsAi09L7mU17VLm6Mg,16,4,2/18/2010,I'm sure there are plenty of cute little hidden cafes around USC that all the students know about and hang out in all day studying. Unfortunately  I didn't find any of them. In the area before an appointment and completely unfamiliar with the neighborhood  I found myself at 23rd St. Cafe. I will say right off the bat that I messed up by not consulting the Yelp reviews before placing my order. If I had  I would have definitely chosen an Indian-Mexican dish like that tikka burrito that sounds so amazing. Instead  i went with a boring tuna melt and fries. The fries were sprinkled with some seasoning that made it a little different  but the tuna melt was basically a tuna sandwich with some toasted bread. Don't get me wrong - I love me a tuna sandwich  but when I order a tuna melt I basically expect a grilled cheese with tuna in it. That means some buttery-ass bread and lots of melty cheese.   Maybe it's been too long since I was in college  but the atmosphere left a bit to be desired as well. The place was ok clean..the bathroom was in good shape  but I had to do a bit of a wipe down before sitting down at a table.   HOWEVER  this business greatly redeemed itself by having a couple of outlets available for laptop use  plenty of tables to spread out on  and for employees who had no problem with me sitting there for hours doing work. Granted  there wasn't much of a crowd in there at all  but never did  I receive a dirty look while I mooched off of their space and electricity.   I'm giving it four stars for their niceness and their usefulness to me when I was in dire need for a spot to sit and work. I hope I have another appointment at USC sometime soon so I can check out that Indian burrito!!,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
1EMNJAZpx5tKT5DkzCtQgw,rQOUZiF_sSIyBsOCWELyHQ,1,5,2/12/2012,Love this place!!! I'm from London and know Indian food! This chicken here is tender and everything is fresh. Although you might wait 5- 10 minutes for a burrito/curry  they cook everything here from scratch so you know you're getting a good meal. Both the Mexican and the Indian is divine! But for those of you with  adventurous taste buds will definitely be rewarded with the Indian-Mexican fusion food! I have never heard of such a concept and was wary at first  but I have never looked back!! Favourite has to be the curry quesadilla.   Overall  this cafe has a really good vibe  nice decor  very well priced and really friendly people behind the counter. They know my name and I've been maybe 5 times!,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
1EMNJAZpx5tKT5DkzCtQgw,jACpVI2pOV12heaCgAq9AA,1,5,6/12/2011,During the four years that I attended USC  I had never heard of this place...and I'm sad that I didn't! I had this enormous craving for a breakfast burrito this morning and luckily fellow yelpers mentioned they had one of the best breakfast burritos here. I would have to agree!  I was completely confused by this place  Mexican food  with a full espresso bar  with American and Indian foods as well. There was a cross  a picture of Ghandi and a statuette of a Hindu god. I usually feel skeptical of when a restaurant tries to do too many things and no things well but I still had a hankering for that breakfast burrito.  The burrito was the perfect ratio and combination of scrambled eggs  cheese  sausage (meat of choice  but they also had chorizo  ham  and bacon) and hash browns. The burrito was literally larger than my face! They wrapped it tight which I liked because I didn't end of with a huge mess at the end which sometimes happens when all the ingredients sink down to the bottom. The only thing I had a problem with was their salsas were a little too watery for my taste. but that may just be personal preference. All in all  I would totally recommend this place  if only just for the breakfast burrito.,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

1EMNJAZpx5tKT5DkzCtQgw,xgFSvMGyZo7-NApcMnnuKg,1,4,9/2/2010,This place was an awesome surprise.  The ambiance is not their thing  from the front  I thought it was a mini-mart.  But the food spoke for itself.  I tried my friend's tikka masala burrito which was fanTAStic.  That was fusion at its best....really good stuff.  I ordered the sourdough breakfast sandwich (at 1 pm in the afternoon...no problem for them at all) and it was REALLY good.

1EMNJAZpx5tKT5DkzCtQgw,RMpz0eJELb-tRYqHnLtfKQ,4,2,4/4/2010,Mm  I don't know about this place.  The owner was REALLY friendly and clearly loves his restaurant/menu  but the food was just OK. The boy and I split samosas and a breakfast burrito. The samosas were filling  but just OK. The breakfast burrito tasted fine when eaten with the green salsa  but without it? Super disappointing. And I really don't like it when food isn't stand alone tasty. Sauce is like icing on a cake. Icing can really improve/ruin a cake  but regardless  the cake needs to taste delicious on it's own and that breakfast burrito that everyone is raving about left SO much to be desired.  Also  the prices are apparently no longer super cheap (as in  this $5 breakfast burrito that everyone is raving about is NO LONGER $5). In fact  it's extremely obvious that they raised the price of almost ALL their menu items by $2-4 because they just cut and pasted new prices over their menu. Der. And it seemed as if the more popular the item  the more the price of that item was raised by. WTF? OK  if you're going to do that  please don't make it so obvious because now I just feel as if I'm getting completely ripped off. If you were willing to sell a product for $4 less than what it currently is listed  clearly you still make money off of said product at the lesser price. So you're just trying to overcharge me  is that it? NOT appealing.  My favorite part of the whole restaurant was the backyard patio  in which there is a bit of quaint  peaceful seating and some lovely trees. A rare find in this part of LA. Unfortunately  the lovely ambiance was kind of ruined by the gas station trash can (the really big  industrial looking ones) that they put out there. Um  ew.  So while the menu was very large and the owner was very (overly?) friendly  I really don't get what the big deal is. The food wasn't that great  and I felt like I was being overcharged. Their one redeeming factor (the backyard patio) lost so many points with that disgusting trash can. I might go back to try their Indian (which looked pretty good  but looks can be deceiving) or fusion food (specifically their tikka masala burrito...)  but I don't know. I'm not excited to go back anytime soon.  ALSO!! I just noticed that 5 of the 8 five star reviews on here are by people with less than 5 reviews total (3 of which have only 1 review total??) which makes me think that SOMEBODY IS TRYING TO RIG THE RATINGS here on Yelp.

1ezFnMTUpnbK9X45cm2sWQ,cOR0f7SLSQfnVnubSCuU5Q,3,3,3/9/2007,So this place is really popular among USC students  and is known for their breakfast menu. My friends and I headed over there for lunch  and sure enough  this place was packed with students  families  and friends. Good sign so far. We were seated in one of the large corner booths  and promptly served. Their breakfast menu IS extensive  ranging from country fried steaks to a variety of omelettes and eggs...kinda of like the Denny's menu...but with more range. I am not particularly a breakfast fan during lunch time  so I ordered their signature Salmon burger.   The wait for the food was not long at all  and the waitress was very friendly. While I waited  I had the chance to look around and see the various LA team memorabilia on the walls. Time passed quickly. :) When my burger arrived  I was somewhat disappointed. The salmon tasted bland..didn't taste like salmon at all  actually... However  I was envious of my friends' dishes because their breakfasty foods were plentiful and tasty looking. They all finished their dishes clean  so I'm assuming the food was good.    Go to Grinder for breakfast foods. They serve it all day  so  don't feel weird to order it for dinner. :) Prices are reasonable. Service is friendly. Parking is right in front.   Pictures posted above.,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1

The breakfast food is great (can't say much for the other food).  The only downside is that the service is not great.  They also don't always have all the ingredients they list on the menu.  If you try to order an omelet with spinach  mushrooms  and tomatoes it's likely they won't have two out of the three.  But if you stick to pancakes and eggs you should be good.

Most of the eateries nearby are either fast food or ethnic  and while a lot of these places have great food they often lack basic comforts.  The food here  is dependable; you know what you're going to get.  I wouldn't go to a place like this for anything aspiring to gourmet  but for basic American (and a few Mexican) breakfast and lunch items  it's a solid bet.  I am partial to the spinach mushroom omelet and my husband likes the chicken-fried steak  which is also delicious.  Their biscuits and gravy are good.  The workers are friendly and service is good - I notice a lot of the same employees are still  there  which means staff turnover is low  always a good sign.  The person who didn't like the decor doesn't understand USC's obsession with sports.  I agree it's  all a bit 70's  but to me that's part of the charm of the place.  I liked the 70's.,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1

While Grinders is a chain restaurant  it still does not allow them to get away with blandness (hell  Denny's has less bland food in my opinion).

I have been to this restaurant at Estancia at least 10 times over the past 6 years and it has changed drastically from 6 years ago.....at least the menu has changed  for the worse.  What hasn't changed is the EXTREMELY SLOW SERVICE.  The only reason I have been here so many times is that it is next door to where I work and this is where we take new candidates for lunch  although I don't think we will ever go here again.  Their menu now is VERY limited.  4 salads  4 entrees and 4 sandwiches (there is a pic of the menu on Yelp).  This time  I ordered the chicken panini with regular fries..... so boring and not gourmet.  I could've made this myself  and in fact the paninis at the corner bakery cafe are SOO much better.  The fries were NOT good either  tasted like the old burger king fries.  They USED to have these amazing garlic criss-cut fries  but no more....  One of my co-workers ordered Mary's Chicken entree which he said was just ok  and my other co-worker got the short ribs which were way over cooked and too small a portion for him to get full.  The co-worker next to me ordered the Tilapia which came out smelling extremely fishy (yuck).  Overall the food is just unappetizing and not at all gourmet.  They DESPERATELY NEED a NEW CHEF (I hope someone at Adobe is reading this).  The one thing they have going for them is the decor and the bread basket with flavored butter to start with  but that does NOT earn them an extra star because overall the entire experience is highly lacking.  In this lunch experience today  we knew that the service was slow  so we asked for the dessert menus at the beginning of when our entrees were ready.  We ordered dessert - 2 pumpkin cheesecake slices to share.  Of course they took FOREVER to come out and guess what  they were LEMON!!  It took us another 15 minutes to inform the waitress because she was nowhere to be found  and then she went back to the kitchen and found out that they were out of Pumpkin cheesecake  and the kitchen just replaced it with lemon without telling her.  Thanks a lot!  We had already paid our bill since we wanted to get out of there although she did offer to take the cheesecake off of our bill and re-run the card  but we said no.  I really hope they change their menu and get a more competent staff because this restaurant used to be soooo delicious  we used to be excited to come and eat here  but now we dread it.,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0
1jq25YkwM8LXbJaJ0EUMkg,F1GeNgdUYqDbxcz5o9_Qpw,1,4,3/24/2008,This review is based strictly on their brunch (Easter Brunch at that):  Our first Easter in San Diego  my wife  sisters and I decided to go to Estancia (mainly because they had openings).  At a first glance  the menu seemed relatively small  but then we went there  and the meal was well worth it.  They had a nice mix of both breakfast and lunch meals.  For me  the highlights had to be the prime rib and the seafood.  That prime rib almost made me cry  it was that good.  The lady carving it up got to know me after a little while.  The seafood selection was pretty surprising.  They had grilled salmon at one station (though the wild grains were dry)  shrimp cocktail  crab legs  tuna sashimi  and an assortment of other sushi rolls.    I didn't want to fill up on breakfast  but they had made to order omlettes  all the breakfast meats  salmon eggs benedict  hash browns  etc...  along with some traditional Mexican favorites like chorizo and chilaquiles.  To cap it off  they had a beautiful dessert bar.  The carrot cake and chocolate fountain were nice  but they're bourbon apple crisp paired with their fresh vanilla bean ice cream is what did it for me.  And for about $60 (after tip)  I was pretty happy satisfied with our choice  considering some places were charging 65-80 per person.  They also had complimentary valet parking which was a pleasant surprise.

Well  after spending $95 five minutes ago  I can say  I am sooooooo dissatisfied with this place and right now  not so impressed by this so highly rated resort.  El Adobe's menu sounded impressive - both pricing and the description of fancyy food. So  after finally checking into our hotel  we decided to celebrate my hubby's bday dinner at El Adobe  the hotel's fine dining restaurant.  What a mistake!  For a western restaurant  I can usually gauge how good the food will be by their bread and dip.  And sure enough  I had my doubts after we were served the bread but hey  I try to be an optimist  which I am usually not.  The half dozen oysters we ordered were served with some tasteless  sweet concoction that forced us to ask for just some home comfort cocktail sauce with some lemon.    I specifically asked what they are known for and the waitress recommended this fancy sea bass cooked in Talliberry crust and served with gnocchi and lotus roots over soy glaze. Sounds promising  right?  ya  I wish!  I could break down everything that was wrong with the dish    - the gnocchi was so hard and dense  perhaps they just reheated it    - the sea bass was tasteless without the scarce ginger sauce and so dry.      - the deep fried lotus root was more for presentation than taste    - the shitake mushroom was a bit over sauted  Moving on to my hubby's steak... The first suspicious hint was that they don't even have steak knives.  What a joke! It was a pain seeing my hubby struggle with his butter knife.  Second thing  he asked for medium rare and of course  it comes out overcooked.   I can honestly say the best thing we had from El Adobe was the fountain coke and sweet potatoes puree.  I didn't have the nerves to try their dessert.  I could have gone to MacDonalds and had better food! And.... Save myself $90!""",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0

Based on some of the reviews of La Estancia from other sites and the 1 star on here  I was worried.  After I walked in  all my worries disappeared.  The buffet was incredible!  They had several different stations set up and food was constantly being replaced (no food sitting around for hours).  They had a lobster tail station  a ham station  an omelette station and a row of warm food which included petite fillets  twice baked potatoes  halibut with spicy rice  ratatouille  and more.  Did I mention the seafood section with fresh shrimp  oysters  and sushi?  To top it all off they had a wonderful dessert section with French pastries  ice cream bar  apple crumb cobbler  carrot cake  chocolate cake and fruit tart.  We were all in a food coma after we were done.  The service was ok  but they could have been a bit quicker to pick up the plates.  I'll give them a pass on that one since they were so crowded.

I'm staying at the Estancia and since it's not conveniently located near any other restaurants (or anything for that matter) I figured it wouldn't be a bad idea to sit at Bodega Wine Bar  have a light dinner and finish up work for the day (I'm staying here for business).  The bartender is here alone  there are about 4 other people in the bar and he seems overwhelmed.  He's a sweet guy  but not really on the ball.  From the bar menu  I ordered the  heirloom tomato stack with organic greens and some honey dressing kind of thing.  What a joke.  If the tomatoes were heirloom  then I'm purple - and there was nothing green on the plate.   It was kind of a caprese salad and had about 3 oz. or food (if that) - even the guys sitting next to me were poo pooing about this dish..  At least it was only $7.  I had some bread  a second glass on wine and am now pondering my next move.  If the tomato thing was remotely good  then I'd stay and give one of the menu items a try  but nuh  uh.

She sat us outside on the deck where we had a gorgeous view of a colorful green lawn and all these beautiful plants. So far  so good. Even the menus were beautiful in this rustic copper gold and turquoise. The waitress was also very nice and helpful  and fast! She described each dish so well we were almost drooling... Made it very hard to choose! It all sounded delicious. I ordered the lobster cobb salad and my colleague ordered the organic chicken  and we split the baja fish tacos as an appetizer.

Can you spare a buck brother; you just may recognize my voice next time? Necessity calls  as I am offered no alternative but to return home to my roots - I am coming home Ma. I am returning to the mom and pop restaurant  where mercifully  you only need to spend a single hour's labor for a lunch.  Yes  they are still out there  lurking on street corners  back alleys and strip malls  all of which I await to discover. Guess what  I found one that is pretty good and just in time.   It is located in a strip mall directly across the street from PCC. TT's Seafood is its name and saving you some money is definitely their game. Well not all of it because let's face it  who cares if you save some money if the meal is a nightmare. For the price of the meals here  which are absurdly economical  the food is superior and far surpasses those few green pictures you must surrender. Good food at some great prices  sign me up  I may not need to take that second out on the house after all. The restaurant is very small and has limited seating. On this visit I ordered the Broiled Salmon ($8.50) this is as good as any Salmon that I have had for twice the price  plus they included two sides.  Are you kidding me  it makes you want to kiss the owner; I hope she doesn't mind  I hope it is a she. I opted for the Vegetables and Cole Slaw.  For my daughter wisely choose the breaded Shrimp ($7.00) which is accompanied with French fries. We are a happy family and thus we share and I was exceeding pleased with both dishes.  This is a value place and well worth the money.  A few months ago I did a story on Fish and Chips and I noted that Fish and Chips are like kissing your sister. Here at TT's the entr\u00e9e is ($6.50)  are you kidding me  now that's a bargain  pucker up sis.  For once in a long time I felt a sigh of relief when the bill arrived. After spending money like a California Politician last month  it was a good feeling to have some money left in my wallet. If you enjoy The Sesame Grill Restaurant in Arcadia  you'll love TT's Restaurant.  Why?  Same owners and they know what they are doing.  This is the fourth Restaurant in the same location in the past five years.  I really think this one is a keeper and will be sustainable.

I did appreciate that the waitress went over this with me twice  so I was certain it would be right.  The egg rolls arrived first. They were essentially flavorless  unless you consider crispy and greasy a flavor. The Pad Thai came out shortly after  and it was chock-full of shrimp. The waitress had walked away before I could say anything  so I called her back over and explained that I had asked for chicken but no shrimp.

The sandwiches are probably the best deal here - they're toasted and include a relatively generous helping of deli meat. Other than that  the salads are not bad although it depends who is actually making them behind the counter. With that said  you can get much better for cheaper about two blocks away - be it at Sufficient Grounds (sandwiches) or Cafe Mattina (salads and sandwiches).  The place is generally packed with Freshmen and Sophomores in between 11 am and 2 pm  meaning that you have to wait in line for about 15 minutes to get your food  10 minutes to pay for it and 5 minutes to find a seat outside. Provided  of course  that you don't want to sit next to a homeless man...,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0

(It took a friend to give me a bite of hers to make me realize this combination is actually really  really good.) I swear it's something in their toasting machinery that makes the bagel come out with the right crisp and taste. It's ridiculously yummy and  being out of college making money  I am still dumbfounded that even specialty bagel places can be beat out by a college-campus cafeteria.  FOUR stars for their tater tots. Those greasy little things are just so deliciously deep fried and crispy...

I've been here twice and have tried the following items: pad see ew with chicken  chicken satay  stewed beef noodle  pineapple fried rice  and fried vanilla ice cream. Everything was good  but I wouldn't recommend the satay. Four skewers for $7  that's almost $2 with tax for one medium stick of meat.  Though the food is tasty  I can't help but to compare the prices of this with USC students' best friend during late night studying  TG Express. Both offer Thai food  but while Trio House offers more quality dishes with better taste  TG Express offers bigger portions (about 1.5 to double the size!) and a cheaper price.

The Pad See Ew was good but the Pad Thai was a little too sweet for my liking.

Some of their dishes like the pad see ew are okay because they're pretty hard to mess up. These are your safe choices.  Others  including beef pho  pineapple fried rice  and sukiyak were edible at best. The beef in the pho was not even edible  and the flavor of the soup was way off (slightly sweet).

Since we were a group of three  we chose three out of the four possible specials and would share our meals with each other.  One friend ordered chow mein with miso soup  salad  and honey chicken  my other friend ordered garlic chicken with salad  gyoza  and jasmine rice  and I ordered the green curry with salad  an egg roll  and jasmine rice.  Everything came out fairly quick and in an orderly manner. I tried mine first... the curry  unfortunately  was on the watery side  but the vegetables were done well and the salad and egg roll were very tasty.

I waited for at least 5 minutes before he came back and started taking my order. I told him  no  I actually ordered over an hour ago  and I was wondering if you could tell me where my driver is.

Got the Thai fried rice with chicken  which I found surprisingly good.  Noticeably sweeter than most other places'  but it definitely brought the flavor out and wasn't enough to make it a dessert.  Wasn't an eye-droppingly huge portion  but it was substantial enough to fill me.  And I was pretty hungry too.   Also got their Thai iced tea to go afterwards.  It's decent  but a bit too much milk.  If you want a good cup  I'd recommend an actual Thai place.   Service was pretty fast  but only because there were only a few other tables occupied.  Service depends heavily on the server  but overall  I didn't have to wait long to hail a waitress.

Before Trio House  my only acceptable Asian choices were TG Express  Panda Express or Soy. But Trio House beats TG Express & Panda and equals Soy in my book. The Fig location is convenient and the parking easy (lot is behind the restaurant). It's much better than the American cafe-type place that occupied the location before. They also do delivery for the area and it's super fast! I swear I once had my food delivered 15 minutes after my phone order... ah - maze - zing.   My favorites here: the hainan chicken and the fried rices. The hainan chicken fulfills my cravings for chicken & rice. The ginger sauce is fantastic  the rice tastes slightly of chicken broth  and the chicken comes out tender.

I ordered the Buddha dumplings first  which is a healthier version of potstickers. It's steamed chicken dumplings with green curry sauce.   I liked the green curry sauce.

It just lacks the oomph and the flavor with bland chicken.  For the main dish  I ordered the Shrimp Lard-Na. It was not bad  but not mind-blowing either. Just plain good. What I liked was the freshness of the vegetables  and the noodles were well-cooked  but the gravy could have been a tad bit thicker  and the flavors weren't as intense and concentrated as I would have liked.  My friend got the Wonton & BBQ Pork noodle (soup).  I liked the broth a lot--it was rich and savory--but the noodles were overcooked.

1x3f4TCx7uvE-slRYJp6eQ,W-Glzi8BpJdlgwAl3zCGlg,8,2,3/23/2010,Sorry  Trio House. As much as I wanted to like you since the USC area really needs some Asian yumminess to break up the fast food clutter along Figueroa Corridor  I just wasn't impressed when I came last week. I know you guys just opened  + you're probably still working out the kinks... so if you read this  I hope you take my criticism as advice for improvement.   =)  I noticed Trio House (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1x3f4TCx7uvE-slRYJp6eQ?select=numjEWfH_wVY1DTSbmv9BQ) while driving along Fig the other day + decided to try it out last week. This location right in front of the Vagabond Inn used to be Eat Street Grill + before that another not very memorable diner-esque place so I was excited to see something different  + especially Asian  there. They have a parking lot in the back that's shared w. the motel. I dragged along my brother  who's generally not very picky about food... but after this experience  it kind of made him think twice about agreeing with me to come here.  The menu has a variety of different appetizers  soup noodles  stir fried noodles  rice plates  etc from different Asian ethnic cultures particularly Chinese  Thai  Japanese + Vietnamese. Think along the lines of the most Americanized or familiar dishes like pad seew  pho  udon  curry  + chow fun just to name a few. The prices seemed to range from about $7-$10 for entrees... which isn't too bad but is kinda pricey for those of us who know that great Asian food can be easily bought for cheap. And trust me... this food from Trio House was not at all amazing for that price.   We started off with a appetizer of Fried Chicken Wings ($7). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1x3f4TCx7uvE-slRYJp6eQ?select=gDb4keMiDpoyiUXWjtVEDA As a lover of nearly all chicken wings  these were pretty decent for my standards... but there were only 6 of them! That's over $1 per wing! Err  unless you count the sweet-chili sauce + lettuce-carrot shreds as a valuable addition to the dish  I wouldn't consider these worth it. For entrees  my brother got Won Ton + BBQ Pork Noodles ($8) plus a plain Milk Tea with boba to drink ($2 + $0.50 for the boba) while I got Sukiyaki ($8)... I'll get to these later.    Now would be a good time to interject that everything took FOREVERRRR!!!   Timeline of events:  Arrived + were seated in nearly empty dining room ~~~  10 minutes pass ~~~  Take our order  another customer is seated next to us  ~~~  15 minutes pass ~~~  Chicken wings appetizer arrives  other customer receives her entree ~~~ 17 minutes after finishing appetizer ~~~  Clear plate + our entrees arrive  other customer finishes her food  pays + leaves ~~~  5 minutes after finishing entrees ~~~  Give us our check + refill water for the 1st time ~~~ 12 minutes after I put down my card ~~~  Finally notice the check is ready + take it  bring it back  Count it. That's nearly a whole hour of waiting!!! Including time eating  it adds up to about 1.5 hours for what was supposed to be a quick lunch!!! Seriously?!?! There were no more than 5 other tables of other customers there the whole time we were there  + considering that there were 5 employees milling behind the counter  I definitely expected the service to be much faster. The customer sitting next to us only received faster service because she very actively flagged down one of the employees for whatever she needed. But really... for the 10 eyeballs behind the counter  at least one set of them should have been watching out for ya know... just in case maybe a customer had empty plates or was impatiently giving them the stink eye or something.   Urgh.  Anyways  onto the food. The Won Ton + BBQ Pork Noodle (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1x3f4TCx7uvE-slRYJp6eQ?select=f160yUt0I6sMOpVfs-oUzA) was dry + tasteless. The egg noodles themselves tasted like they were just boiled with a pinch of salt before added to the bowl with the won ton  pork + some soy sauce. The pork was much  too  lean. For those out there who know what char siu is  having a little fat is necessary for taste + texture. This was pork with abnormally pink food dye bleeding into it  not char siu. The Sukiyaki (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1x3f4TCx7uvE-slRYJp6eQ?select=3XyZhWBs6evu4M1Wp4YrYw) was definitely not normal sukiyaki... I mean... it orange + spicy. Too bad my photo doesn't do justice to how orange this broth really was. Since when is this dish ever spicy??? It's usually sweet + a little salty. The glass noodles were good... but other than that the beef  cabbage + chunky bits of egg were nehhh. Definitely not what I expected as it was made not only wrong but just flat out not good. The portion sizes are decent. One meal for big eaters. 2 for smaller eaters.  Disappointed.   I gave 2 stars rather than 1 only because I don't want to give up on Trio House since I really want a place with food like this around USC to do well.

I've only ordered a green tea  a plate of edamame  and an order of California Roll while studying with a small group. We did get a lot done and the place was pretty packed around Finals time--there's an upstairs which I didn't get to see. I believe they are open late  until 10pm  so it's definitely a nice atmosphere to study in. Free wifi  but for some reason my laptop was having problems staying connected. The waitress there was nice  but I felt that my California Roll took a bit too long because it's not that hard to make. It was a pretty good portion of ingredients for what I ordered. So  aside from the price inconsistency  this place was all-around  not too bad.  For better sushi and more variety (but at a noisier place)  might as well go to Yamato.,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1

I had the lowest expecations. To my surprise  the food wasn't that bad at all. The soup base for the udon noodles was quite decent. I also sampled their spicy tuna roll. Not bad.  The place is filled with college students living in their textbooks. I believe there's free wi-fi too  so everyone has their smart phones  laptops  macbooks  ipads  itouchmyself out. The prices here are college kid affordable.  The dude behind the counter was real cool and mellow. In a sense  this place is a cross between a fast food and a dine-in joint. You don't order from your table because there's really no waiters/waitresses. But if you're eating there  then the food is brought out to you at your table. Refill your own water at the front counter. Let's just say it's a real chilled spot  so leave the make up and date attire at home.  Don't expect much and you'll be fine.

1XBAEhVJ0ntuWZU4PMsxyQ,vmlROhYE-xu1B8AOxXTUiQ,2,3,12/5/2011,This place is the BEST study spot near UCLA.   Actually  scratch that. Iso Fusion Cafe has the BEST cafe study environment that I have come across in all of West LA so far. Literally  I'm here every night during midterms or dead week!  + Strong  stable and FREE WIFI. + LOTS of tables and plenty of study space. Great for students meeting up to work on group projects. + Very spacious with a whole second floor devoted to seating customers + Well lit  with individual lamps on many tables + Plenty of outlets. + OPEN UNTIL MIDNIGHT ON WEEKDAYS. A college student's dream come true!  But it's a real shame that the food and drinks are mediocre  especially given that the food is quite pricy. I've tasted the chicken yakisoba. It was nothing special  and there was way too much vegetable underneath. I also tasted the curry udon  which wasn't great either. None of the drinks I've had here ever stood out  but I usually go with an iced flavored latte regardless.   Finding street parking can be a real hassle  and it's $20 minimum for card  so be sure to bring some cash.

Because if I am having a meal with someone else  it's really awkward to eat in silence or to talk in hushed voices  but I feel bad about talking loudly because there's so many students around studying. I've tried upstairs  downstairs  and even outside (which just made me self conscious eating in the middle of the sidewalk)  but nothing worked for me.  I have friends who study here-- close friends who looove ISO because of its reputation as a great study locale  but I could never do it. Maybe that's why my opinion of ISO is so low  because I'm basing my review pretty much on the food  which is wayyyy too expensive for what it actually is. The sushi is alright  but so overpriced  and even in Westwood  where prices are ridiculously inflated  you can definitely do better.  tl;dr: If you use it as a study place (and can actually manage to study here) then sure  I can see how it could possibly be rated higher  but food wise... meh.,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

Looks like I might have discovered this Asian fusion cafe a bit too late in my UCLA career... this place is not bad at all if you want a Starbucks like atmosphere with Asian bites.  At first glance  I was a bit hesitant at trying out an Asian fusion restaurant located in Westwood.  I've heard a lot of mixed reviews about this place  but for the most part  many have been positive for the free wireless and for it being an actual place to study during midterms or finals (no need to crowd around study lounges in the res halls tonight).  This place is two story with a large study area with lamps upstairs.  You don't have to order anything to be able to study here  but of course  it's only in good taste to order something.  Now for the food... damn  everything here is pricey!  I wouldn't recommend coming here for sushi  as there are better places to get that in Westwood  and it is way over priced ($7 for California Rolls?!).  However  my visit here with a friend led me to order their Chicken Katsu curry for $9 since I was craving some.  You order downstairs at the cashier and they will deliver the food to you  no matter where you end up (top or bottom).  Most dishes come with a bowl of miso soup.  My curry arrived in about ten minutes  and it was not bad at all.  The salad had a tangy dressing that complimented the Japanese curry.  There was also a generous amount of chicken cutlet  so I say that this was worth the visit.  It gets HOT though  so if it's a sunny day  you might find that being outside is better than inside.  There doesn't seem to be real ventilation upstairs  so beware of potential heat waves flowing around.  Aside from that  I like this place  and would come back in the future for a quick bite to catch up  and maybe study for some GREs.,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0

1XBAEhVJ0ntuWZU4PMsxyQ,uH6CqrY691IQaBc9HGTvWw,3,3,3/19/2008,ISO gets three stars  but definitely not for the food. I'm not sure how this happened  but it has suddenly exploded into the most popular place to study I have ever seen.   Food: I tried the spicy ramen after reading some of the posts here. First of all  this is basically Shin ramen with an egg (poorly cooked)  a fish cake  and some unidentifiable vegetables stirred in. Keep in mind that Shin ramen costs like a dollar at an Asian market and the other ingredients are probably even cheaper considering how much you get per bowl. You can definitely make this yourself. Also  my bowl was super dirty when I got it. It seriously looked like my food had exploded during the cooking process. I also got the miso ramen on another visit and noticed that it was prepared like Chinese soup with tons of egg swirled into it. The broth was not flavorful either in the Japanese style or the Chinese style and the veggies in it were a little overboiled. On the plus side  I will say that the ramen is cheap (~$5) in case you desperately don't want to cook. Also  the boba here is a good bet. Update: I tried the katsu chicken curry and it would've been amazing had the chicken been slightly more thoroughly cooked (it was pink and had a raw texture to it). The amount of food you get is impressive especially since you get a tasty salad alongside the heap of curry  chicken  and rice. I'll probably come back for this dish with fingers crossed for better cooking.   Atmosphere: ISO resonates with a nice collegiate/urban charm. The space consists of two stories with ample space for people looking for a good study spot. There's even a cute niche in the corner of the top floor for couples. You can get free wifi here  but the signal is irritatingly bad when loads of students are present. Unfortunately  I happen to come to ISO when those loads of students also decide to come out of the woodwork.  Service: When you order you'll get a number so a server can identify you and hand over the food. Drinks will stay at the cash register though so you'll have to pick those up. When you're done eating  there's a station where you can deposit your dishes and utensils. I don't think tipping is required as a result. Hooray for cheapness!  Synopsis: Seems like a fun place to study if you crave being around people  but don't expect a solid wifi signal. The ramen is okay  but nothing to hyperventilate over. For a good deal try the katsu curries.,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

Lattes are not very good here  although I like their iced teas just fine. As for the food  it's nothing special (and a bit overpriced) but they do offer dishes that you can't really get anywhere else in Westwood (spicy Korean rice cakes  spicy Korean rice cakes with RAMEN!!) and their portions are on the generous side.    4 stars because it offers everything (seats for studying  outlets for yo' laptop  drinks  FOOD) and the owner and employees are always super nice :) I really can't ask for much else.,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1

Just like everyone else has mentioned... this place is very popular for among the 18-25 year old students. When we went upstairs it almost felt we were eating at the library because many students had laptops and books around them.   The food was pretty good. Since we were starving and indecisive on what to order  we ended up getting 2 orders of sushi  beef noodles  pot stickers and spicy ramen.

But don't get the unagi bowl because it's predominantly rice. The rolls  in my opinion  are nothing special and not really worth getting.  In terms of being a place to study  ISO is okay. The free wireless and abundance of outlets is awesome  for sure  but the place can get pretty loud (and crowded during peak times) so I find it hard to concentrate here.

Reminds me of Steve's Korean BBQ back in Berkeley. Very meh restaurant with ratings way higher than they should be.  Order at the front. Self service after. Nothing else really worth mentioning.  They say they are fusion here  but from what I see  its mostly Korean. With a Japanese or maybe Chinese twist here and there. Prices are fairly high for what you get. Tried the chicken katsu and it was the biggest meh of a chicken katsu I ever had. Rice was a little soggy and the katsu was in desperate need of some sort of seasoning. At least it was still crispy. Big portions usually make me happy  but I wasn't compelled to finish this dish at all.  Probably won't come here again. Definitely not the worst restaurant I've been to and their food is definitely edible  but why spend your precious money on such a MEH place?!

They dropped to a C rating once last year  due to rat droppings and attempt to cock block the health inspector. It'll never be the same again.

Now  under new management  the place has rebounded. Not to say the food is epic or anything  it's just decent quality Asian fast food  in a clean environment.

I always walk by ISO because it is so closed to my apartment. So I decided to check this place out. I ordered the boba milk tea ($3.25)  I wanted green milk tea but they did not have it so the girl at ISO mixed their regular milk tea with jasmine milk tea. The drink tasted nasty and the boba was too hard and bland. I don't mind paying $3-$4 for good boba but this is just really nasty that it should be free. I did not think that mixing the tea was a good idea and it wasn't!  There is a minimum purchase of $20 in order to use credit cards which is annoying! But they do have an ATM machine inside the restaurant which charges you some transaction fees to withdraw money from your bank.   There is an upper level where there are many tables available for dining and studying. It is pretty quiet and there is free wifi. One complaint is that after about studying for 15 minutes  the upper level got really hot and stuffy. There are no windows in the upper level and they did not turn on the A/C! It felt really uncomfortable but I ended up staying for 2 hours to study anyways. This would have been the perfect study place if they turn on some A/C for their customers,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0

Alright  let's get down to ISO  now that my neurotic outburst is up.  I'm a film student at UCLA and always looking for businesses where I can write without the LA screenwriter jerkface vibe.

ISO meets all these requirements with flying colors.  This is now my spot.  Sorry  Teaforest  but I'm starting to get addicted to writing on the second floor and ISO's jasmine green tea boba.  Their boba balls are the perfect consistency and have the right amount of sweetness.  It's an extra bonus to sate my boba addiction and my need to get work done.  Hey  don't order the ramen  try the sushi rolls or the bibimbap.  Don't expect Nobu-liciousness  but it's pretty good and you get a salty delicious miso soup with your roll.

You looked spacious from the outside  and when I got to know you  I realized you were even bigger than I thought (a whole upstairs dedicated to study space?!).    As time went on and we got to know each other better  the stronger our relationship grew.  You were everything I needed.  Food? Check.  Bathrooms? Check.  Wi-Fi? Check.   I admit that sometimes I got a little jealous when I went in and saw that you had so many other friends/visitors   I thought you might not have space for me! But every time I began to doubt your capacity to love  you proved me wrong and I always found a seat.  I soon came realize that I would ALWAYS have a seat with you.  Unfortunately  like many guys often do: I began to get bored.  I felt trapped and I had to play the field. I had see what else was out there.  I know you might have heard from our mutual friends that I had a fling with Peet  and that I've been caught late at night with Charles (E. Young).  And I admit that went out with [Santa] Monica [Library] a few times.    But Peet made me use a bathroom key all the time.  Charles stopped letting use the Wi-Fi when I graduated.  And Monica never cooked for me.  It sounds like a cliche.. but I didn't know what I had until it was gone.  Now that I've moved to Culver City... the distance between us has made it too difficult for us to be together.  I'm too lazy to travel (and you don't drive).   I want you to know though... that you'll always be my favorite.  And I'll never forget you.  Love  Eric  PS.

Right now (5 PM on a Tue) it's fairly empty and quiet  but later in the evening it usually gets pretty crowded and can sometimes be quite noisy. But if you're like me and like to study with some distractions around  this is a great place to be!   The food here is okay  I wouldn't come here if you're looking for a place to have a quality meal. Some of the things on their menu seem like they could be pre-made or store bought. The spicy ramen is literally packaged ramen with sriracha and a couple slices of fish cake in it. Not a great deal for 6 bucks but if you're studying late and craving some ramen  go for it. I like the chicken udon here because the noodles usually aren't overcooked and it comes with a decent amount of grilled chicken in it. Their teriyaki chicken bowl is also filling and will come with chicken and stir fry veggies and a bowl of miso soup. You can also ask for extra veggies if you want. But again  this is more of a place to grab a bite while studying or if you're just looking for a quick meal. The service here is great  you order at the counter and they'll bring your food to you in 5-10 minutes!   The cafe itself has lots of tables and seats with an ample amount of outlets around.Also  ISO likes to prop their front door open which is nice because it keeps the air flowing and it never gets too stuffy. One downside of this is that in the summer  it can get really hot upstairs and they don't have much AC on!  One tip-- if you plan on staying at the cafe for a while  choose one of the dark wooden seats with black seat cushions-- the light wood seats have no padding whatsoever and your behind will be aching after a couple hours!""",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1

They also offer hamburgers and hot dogs as well as enough pre-packaged snack items to open up a small 7-11.

That's sort of what I got  it also came with a soft cheese (possible gruyere) that was melted into the wrap  and they also did a good job with the onions; only cooking them to the point where they first began to brown. I liked that.  What I didn't like was the spinach tortilla was a little too brittle to do it;s job as a wrap.  It was fresh and tasty  but there was no way to eat the thing without the thing coming apart in my hands.  The wrap is served with a side order too. I chose the homemade potato chips that turned out to be absolutely awesome  although they do offer fruit or a small prepared salad instead.  the wrap came to $7.00 and i almost bought a Diet Coke for another buck.  But Rami offered me a sample of the fresh homemade lemonade.  It was awesome; perhaps the best I have ever had. It was a little sweet  a little tart and not at all sour.  A 20 ounce glass was $3.00 and worth every penny of it.  ""Gourmet Food Truck #110 on my never-ending quest to try every truck in So Cal""""",0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0

A relatively new food truck to the scene and the truck wrapping is pretty intriguing  you're going to want to take a look at what exactly a truck with this exterior is doing  as it could be either insane or insanely delicious   Thankfully it was the delicious one. Their menu takes a bit to get your mind wrapped around it. Indeed  I was getting wrapped silly just looking at it.   I tried a bit of the sloppy joe's and had a philly steak. Both of which were really on point.  The real selling point to me about this truck is the options. While I always complain about trucks being all over the place and not having a clear focus  this truck's head is in the game and the food taste good for being varying degrees of items that don't necessarily seem to go together well.   Like  who would have thought that a place that has wraps  sloppy joe's  philly steaks and fried zucchini would be great? But seriously  the fried zucchini was spot on. Crispy with just enough oil to make the batter crunchy.   The employees for the truck are also pretty friendly. They're also very giving when it comes to the samples of the food as well.

21Hhze2wdfGpnS8v49ydbQ,k7-bihZRebSZYYDenMzF_A,7,5,12/1/2010,I am bumping up my stars another .5. Since Yelp doesn't allow halfsies  I have to round up and I am comfortable with that. As I continue to review more and more  I try to be stingy with my 5 stars  but the experiences I've been having with NoRes has hit all points.  Shortly after my first visit and review of NoRes  I found out that they were nearby my office and I changed my plans for lunch to visit them. I already had a late brekky so I didn't plan on eating alot. I headed over mainly to give a little support to a foodtruck since trucks in downtown seem to be fading. It was funny to be recognized by Sheldon and his wife because of the review I had written a few days before. HAHAHA.  I was a little disappointed that the grilled cheese sandwich that was a special the previous week was no longer on the menu. Well my loss  it was a special after all. Instead  I scanned over their permanent menu as I chit chatted with Sheldon. He had already mentioned his favorites before and I kept reading and re-reading the menu  waiting for something to pop out at me. The Off the Hook wrap wiggled its little fish tail and caught my attention. I thought I would try a sample bite and be content with that.  Sheldon (that evil man) just grinned and said its his wife's favorite.  The Off the Hook wrap was simply marvelous. By the way  salmon is one of my least favorite fish to eat. I usually only eat it because its so readily available at eateries. One bite of it left me in fascination of what I was tasting. The wild salmon and basmati riceis prepared with lemon dill and added asparagus. Along with it is a wasabi aioli that took me by surprised. I even had to dissect my wrap to see what was inside to double check. The little fish roe were just perfection. I wound up eating the rest of the wrap with a spoon so I could get each little salty pellet with the salmon. I didn't want to waste a single bite of it. I wound up eating the whole thing because it tasted so good. The wrap was not heavy at all.   I found out the mastermind behind some of  if not all  is Chef Tony inside the truck. I had to give him proper praise and thanked him. I turned and found Sheldon doing that mischievous grin he does. I knew I was in trouble.  Jin  have you tried one of our desserts? Cheesecake perhaps?  DAMMIT.  My wife is a pastry chef and these are all her creations.  DOUBLE DAMMIT.  I had a hard time choosing between the Key Lime and the Raspberry White Chocolate. I chose the latter. Very very good. So silky smooth was the texture. Because it came in a tiny little foil cup it likened itself to a rich pudding or budino. A nice surprise was the chocolate crumb on the bottom. I highly recommend their dessert. Look for it in their little window on the side.  I finally leave with this.... I read from other reviews that NoRes is slightly pricey. Yes  I would readily admit they aren't cheap food  but they make very good food. Some of the tastes and flavor profiles I am experiencing from NoRes would easily be charged $3 - $5 or more if they had their own brick and mortar bistro.

From the list of ingredients  I expecting a nice array of flavors to pop in my mouth  but it was more like a bland mush that worked against the lamb. Should have been more meat in the wrap to balance it out.  The $3 garlic fries are billed as ""#1 in Los Angeles"" -- so I had to try them. Pleeaze  how do people get away with this type of hype? Exactly who chose these fries as ""#1""? They are battered potatoey sticks that are mushy on the inside and lacking in garlic flavor and aroma. The frozen garlic fries sold in the freezer section at Trader Joe's are better than these.   On the price side: As a comparison  No Reservations are serving a Pan Bagnat sandwich at $8. I can order the same sandwich at a local French bistro  sit at a nice table and be waited on and still pay 75 cents less -- so yes  definitely overpriced (granted  I'd have to tip  but you get the picture).""",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

At the food truck festival in Santa Anita  the lines to most trucks were up to 3 hours long... yea  I'm not joking...   As I was wandering around to look for a truck with a short line  I saw the No Reservations Catering truck... and their line were short! JACKPOT! The reason the line was so short  was because they only had 2 items left to choose from  which was chicken and lamb. I decided to try their lamb wrap  which consisted of lamb  Middle Eastern styled rice and hummus and a few more items I can't remember. One word -DELISH. I had no idea truck food could be so good. I'm totally hocked now  and I'm blaming No Reservation Catering for it.   People had to wait for their food for over 1 hour after ordering  so the sweet manager (I believe it was Sheldon Katz who is the owner/general manager) gave every waiting customer her business card where it said we get one free chips plus drink for our next visit  and we also got to choose a free bag of chips or a muffin from the truck. That was so cool of them to do that since other guests had to stand in line for hours for the other trucks.

I know this whole cheese  pork  onions  fruit in a sandwich business sounds pretty questionable but I assure you it was anything but.   The sandwich was $8 and well worth it. Just a second too late I noticed that they have orange cream soda. I asked to add it but she had already rung my order through. She happily gave it to me on the house. And I tipped her $4 for her trouble. It was a super good soda too.  I decided to drive my food home so that I could curl up in bed  watch the Penguin's game and enjoy my heavenly sandwich.   I wish I had eaten the sandwich right when it came out of the truck so that it was super fresh and hot because the five minute drive to my house made the bread a little hard around the edges.

Once I stopped and looked at the menu basically every single thing sounded so damn delicious.  I ordered the Rosemary's Baby wrap + truffle fries. Heaven. Yum. O.M.G. Coworker adored his Illusionist sandwich too. My only minor complaint is that there was a lot of oil coming out of my wrap. Otherwise the food was f-ing fantastic and I can't wait to work my way through the entire menu. Next up for me is the Atlantic Salmon wrap.  While we waited for our orders to come up the owner was crackin' jokes and bantering with customers totally making me want to order from this truck even if I hadn't absolutely loved the food. He even offers to buy your meal back from you if you don't like it. How can you pass up an offer like that?,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

The menu is impressive  boasting creative steak  lamb  chicken  or vegetarian wraps named after famous films.  I ordered Silence of the Lamb and garlic fries.  The fries were excellent  especially with the homemade caperberry anchovy aioli...though I have to admit  I thought it was a normal dijon ailoi until I looked up the menu...I would have liked a little more of the advertised flavor.  The Lamb inside the Silence of the Lamb wrap was very good  but I was a little bit let down by the rest.  I got hints of the sweetness from the pomegranate  but the individual flavor was completely absent.  The rice inside was also a bit undercooked  and I found the wrap to be dry.  The flavor was good though  different and unexpected.    We'll check out this place again to be sure.  I was pleasantly surprised by the creative menu  and want to try more!

At least it did for me. I had to choose the Good Fellas when I saw it on the board and let me tell you  it was an offer that I couldn't refuse.   Grilled steak with roasted garlic potatoes and all the rest just hit the perfect spot. Especially with the horseradish creme   Their grilled cheese was also much better than a certain other food truck's grilled cheese specialty. It may have been alike in price  but in the taste department it was damn good. You really can skip the line from that other truck because this one  while it takes no reservations  walk up's won't keep you waiting around.   Another bonus for those of you who just don't carry cash on you  is that the truck accepts your credit card. So you can stop bitching about food trucks not taking plastic.   The service on the truck is second to none. It's really on its game with friendly and fast turn around. I guess the only thing that I could think negatively of this fine establishment is that the prices are up there. But really  you'll be more than happy to pay it once you taste their food.,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1

Out of all the trucks at the SM Food Truck Lot this Tuesday night  I took a chance on the special burger  and was thoroughly disappointed - by more than just the food.  I placed my order  the special Bistro Burger  rare.  When she said that it was a 6oz patty  I asked for an extra patty - and was given a quizzical look before she called the owner over to give her a price for my request.  He came over and said it would be an extra $4 - then looked at me and asked if I realized how big that would be.  1st of all  I'm asian so it's a safe bet that I can do basic math.  2nd of all - why are you questioning how hungry I am?  Whatever.  I told him that I only will eat the meat  so he tells the cashier - oh  just make it bunless for her then"".    HE got a quizzical look from her  and she asked ""bunless?"".  I realized this confused her  so I said it didn't matter  that I could just eat around it.  But the owner says ""no  just make it bunless"".  I guess she got it  because she wrote something down.  Then I asked for no added salt  and got another quizzical look.  Really?  Am I THAT difficult?  It's is  after all  just a burger.  She said there was already seasoning in the meat  and I said fine - just no added salt then.  So she repeats back to me - double patty  no added salt.  And I say ""don't forget rare"" - and she says ""oh  that's right"" - and writes something more down.  My burger was up pretty fast  and it was hot  and it was definitely rare.  But this is what it was supposed to be:  ""Hamburger Hill"" Bistro Burger  rare  bunless  add extra patty ($8 + $4) - topped with muenster cheese  lettuce  tomato  grilled onions and a sweet chili sauce   and this is what it really was:  2 burger patties  rare Thousand Island dressing Shredded iceberg A slice of tomato No cheese No grilled onions No sweet chili sauce (unless the Thousand Island dressing was that chili sauce and I didn't realize it)  The burger patties tasted like sausage - either it was the seasoning mix  or there was actual ground sausage mixed in to the meat.

Workers from all the surrounding businesses slowly started creating lines at each truck.

He handed me a menu told me i should try the rosemary's baby. It was great i didn't even have to get out of my car nor did i have to wait in the long line. i paid the nice man and got my wrap minutes later :)   When i tried the rosemary's baby wrap  at first i was thought  damn how did i totally get suckered into buying this over priced burrito? The first few bites were ok  still not up to parr with the price but as i continue with each bite it got better and better! the chicken was so tender! and the cous cous was DE-LISH! half way through the wrap i was stuffed! but i couldn't stop eating. At the end it was 8 dollars well spent :)   My first time experience was so good i had to go back for more. So last night i came across No Reservation Catering again and couldn't decided from trying rosemary's baby again or the good fellows. We flipped a coin because i couldn't decide and i ended up getting the Good Fellows. It wasn't as good as Rosemary's baby  the steak was good  but i tasted alot of garlic.

It's designed for college students and the occasional tourist  and should be inexpensive  tasty  relatively nutritious  and quick.   T-Toust fills the bill nicely.  I don't speak Korean (big surprise there)  but I suspect that the little square character with the T IS the name  and they also spell it out for us Anglos.    They have an extensive menu  featuring the usual Korean specialties plus a few more unusual items  with their daily specials a couple of dollars cheaper than on the regular menu. At lunch time patrons are cheek by jowl and waiting  with only one amazingly efficient and overworked young woman taking orders  serving  cleaning tables  moving the 3 chile sauce bottles from table to table  and running the register  so one might say the service is not the best   although if I were looking for an employee  I'd hire her in a heartbeat.

Today was bibimbap Monday! It was a large portion and it was not that bad. Price: $6.91 (including tax). One thing that I do like about the place is that it has the feel of a trendy Korean restaurant. Clean interior and quick service. Definitely better than Bear Ramen and Kimchi Garden!

I got their hot beef soup and I asked for the least amount of spice possible and i ended up drinking 3-4 glasses of water and eating tons of rice and leaving with a mouth filled with spice. The food was pretty good though.  This place does come with a price and in my opinion is a tad over priced for the proportion they give. Now I don't know if its normal for korean places to give small proportions  but for $8 for a hot beef soup  I was expecting something a little bigger. The size of the bowl was small. My gf order something else and her bowl was about 1/3 of the size. I am disappointed with the serving size but amazed at the spice they put into their food.

Haven't seen a Korean working the cash register or kitchen over there in a while. But this place  T-Toust (no idea why they do that T-T thing)  is pretty legit. Prices have gone up recently  and it was a shock when I went there earlier tonight with a friend (really fobby Korean guy) and saw that bi-bim-bap (mixed rice with vegetables and meat) was $7+. I was a little disappointed the meat in the bi-bim-bap wasn't bulgogi (marinated beef) but marinated ground beef. That's cool and all  but it's a little cheap...   Anyway  they serve purple/white mixed rice which is really yum  and even healthy too. There's real Koreans working the cashiers and the kitchen  which gives an authentic sort of Korean cuisine. I like the place  and so do the fobs. I see them there a lot. Big thumbs up.,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0

Lots of Koreans eating here is a good sign. Although it used to be a cool spot for Americanish grub about a year ago  it's new incarnation has grown on me. What I like most about T-Toust is that they include about six different side snacks with each entree  ranging from salty  sweet  hot  to fishy -- which add a lot of variation to the dishes.   I've had Bi Bim Bap  Grilled Pork  and today the Spicy Chicken. Of the three  I like the Bi Bim Bap most  but the others were satisfying as well.

You know it's good when you have white cream smeared all over the top/side of your mouth after biting into one of these delectable treats. This place is so addicting and delicious.

Not overly sweet as I imagine. They actually stuff them with cream when you order them so that the texture of puff stays lightly crispy on outside and cream filling is fresh  fluffy. The original flavors is very delicious and my favorite. Green tea is okay  but lacks intensity in sweetness and flavor as green tea ice cream. Pumpkin is tasty and perfect during holidays.    My only complaint is service can be slow at times  resulting in long wait due to only one worker sometimes taking orders and filling the pastries. They've also run out a few times.

24c8tiJyX8js_pUpEtW3fA,r4TexcbDrw-_t9RZH3HKAA,1,2,5/16/2012,Don't get me wrong  I am definitely a fan of Beard Papa's! Their cream puffs are the perfect size and the cream is always light and fluffy. However  my experience from today has made me realize one thing -- don't buy Beard Papa's unless you're served by a worker who actually gives 100% good service.  I had bought a Groupon deal months ago ($8 for $16 worth of Beard Papa's) and today was the last day to use it. So like many others  I had stopped by to buy myself a box of cream puffs. The line was long and I could tell the two workers were trying really hard to get to everyone  but things went downhill from there...  - I ordered 6 original cream puffs and 2 cookie cream puffs. They decided to ring me up AFTER they had put everything in a box. It turns out my total was $14  when my Groupon allowed for $16 worth. I could have got another cream puff or even a drink  but they didn't even inform me. I had only realized this while I was in my car looking at the receipt.  - They were trying to put together so many boxes at once that they finally ran out of work space. A guy worker decided to go in the back  grab some crates  and create a makeshift table. The problem? He grabbed the dusty crates while wearing gloves and used those very same gloves while handling the cream puffs. I was so glad the girl worker handled my box  but I feel bad for every customer behind me.  - They had left cream puffs in the oven for quite a long time and it started to smell burnt inside the facility.. burnt cream puffs? Yeah... no.  - I finally took a bite out of my cookie cream puff and was SO disappointed! They had skimped out on the cream! Normally when I buy Beard Papa's  the cream would overflow.. I mean  better to have more cream than no cream at all! My cream puff was only half-filled! The rest was all bread...  From now on  I'm going to stick to other Beard Papa locations.,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0

Matter of fact  I sometimes have dreams that I am magically transported to a land with unlimited access to these delicious cream puffs. Seriously  I get really bad cravings for it.   But having said that  not all Beard Papa's are in the same league. I've only been to two locations - Berkeley (Bay Area) and Pasadena (LA). And while I like the city of Pasadena better  the Beard Papa there is horrible. Just awful. I went on two different days  just to make sure the first time wasn't an off day. Sure enough on both days the cream puffs were stale tasting and the custard filling was *gasp* lukeWARM!!!! ewwwwwww.... nasty. A huge no-no. Custard should be served either cold or hot (like a creme brulee). So yeah. Despite my love for the city of Pasadena  I'm definitely NOT coming back here again.,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

I've only been to the original location in Japan  so I was pleasantly surprised when I came across this one in Pasadena of all places.    When I saw the Pumpkin Cream Puff I knew I had to have it.  I love all things pumpkin  and its one of my favorite reasons for the Fall Season!  For $1.95  you get a large cream puff the size of your fist filled with oozing  cold  smooth  pumpkin flavored cream.  The puff itself is light and delicate  perfectly complementing the cream filling.  Yum-o!,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

I prefer the regular flavor.  Tried the chocolate  but it fell short of my expectations; the chocolate cream is too overpowering for such a delicate pastry.  They rotate special flavors on a weekly basis  I think  with regular and chocolate offered every day.  I was looking forward to trying either the green tea or the coffee flavor during my most recent visit  but the featured flavor of the week was banana.  I didn't think I would be a fan of the banana flavor  but surprisingly it was quite tasty and I would definitely order it again!    Price per cream puff = $1.95 --- but you get a discount if you buy them in bulk (in packs of 6  I believe).  The boba drinks aren't bad.  I tried the thai iced tea ($2.75); not the best I've ever had  but will satisfy your thai iced tea fix if you haven't had it in a while.

Some very generous cream pumping goes on and things can get very messy  but you get your calorie value worth indeed. The cookie version is good but the original puff is still the best.

I think they have changed their menu options though as they have a larger variety of deserts. Also  they have a couple of drinks to choose from as well. I got a Thai Iced Tea along with friend with a couple of mini puffs. I think the mini puffs are a great idea and are good as the regular puffs.

Strike #1  don't look like you're closed when clearly there is an open sign at the door.    When we got to the counter  two workers emerge from the back to take our orders.  I asked for a XXX Vitamin Water and the girl picks up an orange bottle.  I say no  it's the purple one.  She takes out three different bottles and have me point to the one I want.   Strike #2  know your product.   As we sat down to have our cream puffs and drinks  they went right back into the back and we were the only ones in the store again.  As I was watching the street  I saw countless pedestrians that could have been potential business just slipping away because the place looked closed aside from the awkward signs of life with just three of us sitting in the store.   Strike #3  at least act like you care and do your job.  This place could use some reviving by handing out some samples  since the cream puffs are going stale anyway by sitting there with no one to buy.  Have a body outside promoting  or at least have a body in the store behind the counter so that it looks welcoming and open.  Fix your beverage cooler because the drinks are warm.

It's conveniently located right under my doctor's & what drew me to this place was the name  the coziness...the giant chalk board. Lol This place can be easily missed or looked over but it is truly a hidden gem.   First time I tried it  I didn't read any reviews didn't check Yelp  just wanted a nice hot drink.  Ordered the Chai Tea & got the small because I wasn't sure if it would taste good or not & ahhh major regret for not getting the larger size!! The chai was very hot  punched me in the face with flavor & was a lil frothy.  Now I look forward to going to the doctor's so when I leave  I can buy my delicious Chai. Only thing that sucks is that they have ruined Starbucks & Coffee Bean for me & when I do stop coming to the doctor's I know I'll crave it..Meaning I'll have to wait til the end of my work day & go out of my way for it but SO WORTH IT!

It looked so cute  and I just knew I had to try it! Came back again and was sad to find it was closed. Just as I was walking away  the owner came and unlocked the door. Hmm  okay. It was the middle of the day?   Anyway  it had chairs and tables set up inside the cafe  and outside (it's actually housed in an indoor mall"") next to a bubbling fountain. Adorable! Except  I feel like it's kind of sketch sitting by yourself in a dimly lit place just drinking coffee. Most of the stores in this place are closed every time I go through there  no matter if it's a weekday  weekend  morning  or night. Very odd.   The prices for this place are very reasonable. I got an americano with soy and added splenda to it. The gentleman (the owner  I assume) was just friendly and helped me out very much. Unfortunately  I forgot to specifiy that I wanted it iced. And it was in the middle of the summer. At 3 PM. Geez. Anyway  when I finally got myself home and sufficiently cooled down  I found it was very delicious! I had to keep asking him for more soymilk  because he didn't quite put enough for me  but he was very accommodating and did just so.   There are some food items on the menu  and some pastries+cookies on display. I wanted to get a croissant to go along with my coffee  but I noticed a tiny  tiny gnat buzzing around. Definitely not my thing. Also - another thing that I noticed was weird was the absence of sound  or music. It was simply very  very quiet.

As you probably know  Hare Krishna serves its all-vegetarian-and-sometimes-vegan meals every Wednesday at lunchtime on the patio of the Old Student Center.  $4 for as much food as you can fit onto a plate.  Sounds like a good deal?  On a monetary basis  sure it is.  But there's a serious problem: the food is NOT actually something that I want to eat.  When I was here last time  Hare Krishna was serving its usual array of mushy and pasty things.  There was one dish that looked like couscous.  It looked tasty  but good lord -- it was loaded with sugar.  It was lip-smackingly sweet.  It wasn't at all what I was expecting  and the surprise wasn't a pleasant one either.   Next up: a spinach dish.  This concoction looked vaguely like saag paneer  but didn't taste like saag paneer.  Instead  it was completely bland.   It sure felt rich  given the way it sank to the pit of my stomach  but it didn't taste like anything.  Finally  to wash all this down  I had a glass of fruit punch.  Somehow they even screwed this up -- again  it was loaded up with obscene amounts of sugar.  It tasted like molasses thinned out with Kool-Aid.    I thought vegetarian food was supposed to be healthy.

Parking (if you aren't already on campus) is tough; there's a loading zone off Gilman on Mandeville loop  and a small parking lot just past that.  Probably wouldn't get an A-rating to be honest..  The Service- It's two guys  one taking money and one refilling food. (It's a buffet!)  The Food- Very interesting; I'm a meat-eater  and never thought this could make me so happy! Something like a mix of Ethiopian/Indian/Asian food.  Courses vary; grab a plate and wait 30 minutes  and they'll be serving something different.   Recommended- for the price and the experience.

2C_ggj_PARSy6a-qnqEkrA,JpdnkcBElbDcbOJ1_ea-3w,1,4,10/8/2008,$4. Yes  you read right. Less than $7 to eat on campus. You might say I'm crazy  but it's true. First of all  if you've never heard of it I wouldn't blame you. It's only on Wednesdays and it's in the old (?) student center. Basically by the Guardian Office  above the Food Co-Op and Hai Tai Restaurant. Know where the bike shop is? Ok  you're in the right area. Just follow all the hungry students going up stairs.  They only have three items most of the time and the food is either pretty good or okay. One of them is rice  then there are two other dishes of various colors. I don't always know what they are  but I'll eat them. Rule of thumb for me is if it's yellow  it's DELICIOUS  if it's green it's probably good  and if it's red it's probably ok. Trust me on the yellow stuff. Mmmm mmm! Totally worth a try for the price and you can bring your own Tupperware and have food for the rest of the day.   Like others have said  this isn't a fancy venue at all. It's a tent canopy thing  some tables and big containers of food that you scoop onto your plate in huge portions. And there's a line. Always. But you know  I'll always choose them over Price Center on a Wednesday because I'll get full off of little money and the food has this home-made taste. How I miss home-made food!,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0

Although they only serve vegetarian dishes  it's pretty delicious. When I was there  they served long grain rice with a spinach curry-like dish and garbanzo beans with some type of squash. There was also a dessert that has this grainy texture with bits of peaches. It was very weird because it tasted like apple pie  but the texture of it was kind of gross. They also served some type of juice  not sure exactly what it was  but again  a little weird  but not nasty. I loved the spinach and garbanzo beans.

But don't expect Punjabi Tandoor quality or 5-star customer service - 'cause  there are none. The closest you can get is perhaps a nod from the cashier dude.   Typically the weekly selection consists of 2 or 3 different dishes plus a suspiciously-colored dessert. Although I am never too sure of what I am eating  I find the food agreeable to my uber sensitive stomach. The flavor is on the lighter side; if you are used to heavy dosages of MSG or spices  Hare Krishna is probably not for you. The dessert is somewhat unusual; at one point they served this green mush that tasted much like mint chocolate chips blended with rice. The bottom line is  this is an acquired taste. Take it or leave it.  Many people bring their own tupperware to super-mac-size their portions  and I have yet to see the Hare Krishna guy flag down anyone for taking too much food. Anyhow  it is nice knowing that portions are not limited. Now if only I get to find out what I am eating...

I am an avid lover of all kinds of Indian food  including having an Indian Roomate who's mother constantly brings home cooked meals and when I heard there was a cheap delicious Indian buffet I ran to the opportunity. Not only that  but I invited an enormous amount of people garuanteeing them happiness. Needless to say  I've learned my lesson. At arriving there was a man walking in circles who hardly noticed us. After reading others reviews I brought my own Tupperware and everything  but after filling it with the sort of canned vegetable and tomatoes sauce mixture I realized that I had wasted my time. The only thing I can mildly agree with is that the dessert was decent enough  but the hours old food was not doing it for me. Out of friends and I  none of us finished any of our food and ended up just getting somosas from the food co-op.

Second  it's down right delicious. I always pile it sky high on my plate. I don't know the names of the different dishes  so I just call them based on their color.  The red one is pretty good (one with garbanzo beans)  the yellow one is alright  but the green one is my favorite (one with broccoli and potatoes). They alternate between different dishes every week  but I've never seen that pasta one people are talking about. There's also a dessert  which is good  but I'd rather not waste space for it on my plate. I'd rather get more rice and more of those delicious curry type dishes. They also give you this great pink colored tea to wash down the food. If you're feeling greedy  bring a tupperware (they allow any size  my friend brought a tub once) and pay $6. It sucks that it's only on Wednesdays  but they have it throughout the year -- even in the summer. The line can get long  but it moves fast. I think this is probably also the best vegetarian option on campus for students. So get their early  grab the best food you'll find on campus  and take a seat on the grassy hill.

It is offered by the UCSD food co-op  which is an organic health food store in UCSD's old student center. It is available every Wednesday  but only during lunch hours. The Hare Krishna folk set up a kitchen on the second store of the Old Student center  right next to the UCSD Guardian office.   A lot of students eat at Hare Krishna because the food is so damn good and you can't beat the prices. For about $3 you get all you can eat world-class Indian food. My mouth waters when I think of the delicious plates vegetarian curry  and sweet rice that I use to consume when I was a student at UCSD. I would eat vats of the curry  but I always felt good after consuming a large Hare Krishna meal because the ingredients are all natural and all the food is organic.   Hare Krishna  serves sweet rice that makes for a great dessert and a drink comes with every meal.

You never know what they're serving until you're piling it onto your plate. There's no set menu  but everything is delish.  The prices are ridiculously good too. All you can eat for like...$7! And a HUGE plate full is only $4. You can even bring your own tupperware and bring things home with you. They NEVER complain about how muchyou take. I've seen people take BUCKETS worth of food home.   The guy working there is quiet and not very communicative  but who cares! The food is great! The yellow curries are the best.

2C_ggj_PARSy6a-qnqEkrA,ZGseYRCQdbOXgnriM1e4LA,2,4,8/13/2008,Probably one of the best kept secrets at UCSD  Hare Krishna has Indian food from the Vedic Society every Wednesday from around 11ish to 1:30. They serve buffet style for $4.00 and take home for $6.00. I guess with the slumping economy  even the Vedic Society needs to make money because they used to charge only $3.00 back in the day. They usually serve starchy food that is all vegetarian. Today  it came with long grain rice with vegetable curry and paneer in tomato sauce with some type of pasta shaped like large rice grains. I've never had any of their paneer so it was something different  and since it was in a tomato sauce and had pasta  the whole thing tasted like an Indian version of lasagna  which was interesting. It also came with cream of wheat for dessert and a cup of berry tea juice (that red stuff).

All in all I recommend this place especially for people who are new to sushi and would like to experience a wide range of dishes without shelling out lots of $  but if you're looking for outstanding taste you'd better head out to San Francisco for the best of the best.,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1

It was a mistake for me to come here as the place is loud and un-clean (to put it mildly)  service is terrible (I had to approach the server to remind her we were ready to order)  sushi is below average. I think the only reason this place is still around is because typically students can eat here cheap.  Because the place was not the cleanest  we wanted to sit at an outside patio. It was closed. We were seated next to the table with a very loud couple of friends who where laughing so loud my ear drums were about to pop.   And what's worse  this place does not serve alcohol. What???

Sushi rolls here are actually pretty small  but at least they're affordable.  You can get enough to get your fill without breaking your wallet.

This place kinda sucks  but I still go there regularly because it's the best sushi place that's close enough to my work to be able to eat lunch at. I've never had a problem with service but I've only ever gotten takeout. The prices aren't really all that cheap when you compare them to other sushi places... For example  their Golden Bear Tutoring Roll"" (avocado/salmon with masago on the outside) is $4--just the same as at Sushi House (theirs is called the ""Oregon roll"")--but far inferior in quality. The salmon is often mushy  in multiple pieces  and sometimes has weird tough grey skin-like layers on it. The rolls are often not very well put-together & will fall apart when you try to pick them up. Sometimes the food is better than others. It's edible  but not great by any stretch of the imagination. Their miso soup is pretty good though.  2/13/07: Okay  I need to edit this because the last time I went there  which was several months ago  I got a salmon/avocado roll in which the avocado was CRUNCHY and there was a weird crunchy bit on the salmon too. Yuck! I haven't gone back since.  5/7/07: Breaking my vow to myself to never return  I went to Tako sushi for lunch on Friday. I have never regretted anything more. I took a picture of what they try to pass off as ""salmon"" and I'll try to post it here. Unfortunately I got my food to go and was too damn lazy to return it when I opened the box and saw how awful it was. No more Tako Sushi for me  ever. I mean it this time.

I first went to Tako Sushi when I was a freshman (I'm now graduated) and what I really liked was how many vegetarian options they have.   Other pros about the place: it's pretty cheap and it's close to campus  so it was always an easy place to meet up for lunch.  A friend and I have been meeting there every week for lunch lately.  They kept getting her order wrong (the ashby roll) by putting the fake crab meat in it  which she hates.  Then one night I went there with Derek and ordered the fresh veggie roll  took a bite  and realized they also slipped the fake crab meat in THAT.  I almost gagged.  They gave me a new roll and for free  but other than that  definitely didn't seem to care that they just gave a vegetarian meat and could have had a much worse health situation on their hands.  (Longtime vegetarians do not well with meat.)  Since then  I've always checked the veggie roll before eating it.   Now I know I've should have checked everything -- today when my friend and I met up  I ordered the fresh veggie roll and the veggie crunchy roll.  They gave me the chicken teriyaki crunchy roll instead  which from above looks exactly like the veggie roll.  I bit into it and nope  not the veggie crunchy roll.  The main waiter (the guy with glasses that is always there) definitely didn't care very much and said he had nothing to do with the order.  Fine  but if your restaurant consistently has problems getting orders right at ALL (and this has nothing to do with the quality of the roll)  then you do have something to do with this.  Fix this.  I've had a bad stomachache for the rest of the day.  (Also  they gave me this one for free  but didn't bother to write up a new check so it was included in the tax.  Cheap!)  Now I know to always check everything  but it's a pity you can't just trust it.   Oh and lastly  they always play TERRIBLE Christian music.  The only good thing is you can make fun of it.  Additional bad service today (04/29/2010): One of the waitresses gave our order to another table  that table didn't notice it looked NOTHING like their order  and started digging in.  The male waiter (the one always there with the glasses and bald head) then actually gave us the roll that they started to eat.  Really?  He thankfully took it away  made a new one  and gave us a small discount.  One reason I like when they mess up -- more discounts for us.""",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0

This place is the epitome of starving college student lowest grade sushi. Transplanting this restaurant anywhere else with a decent sushi appreciating crowd would probably make it implode from the gravitational pull of its own suckiness. Srsly.  I remember coming here when I was a wee freshman loooooong ago. I was the only one who ordered sushi out of my friends. I figured why visit a sushi restaurant and order something like a terikaki bento? Made no sense to me. It was too bad for me that the logic that usually served me well backfired on me and helped my friends whom I thought made a dumb choice. The sushi was terrible.  I made the mistake of visiting a couple of more times during my undergrad years. I guess I am a sucker for pain. 3 stars for their OK non-sushi dishes and 2 stars (pushing it even at that) for their bad sushi. Even Tako Sushi doesn't deserve a 1 star bad buffet sushi rating.

The rolls are big - dont worry  they'll fill you up good.  Regular-grade  crumbly rice and fish that's neither fresh nor good quality.  Menu consists mostly of sushi restaurant staples.  The specials look complicated and intimidating.    But hey  we're poor college students.  At this point in our lives  not many of us can afford to have good taste  and Tako Sushi is cheap  near campus  and does the job.  Hell  it even has a side menu explicitly labed starving student menu"" filled with various carbocide options priced $7 and under that will keep your stomach happy.  And I appreciate the free sodium (or miso) soup.  No matter the quality  I'll continue to be a patron once every blue moon  to add a little variety to southside dining options.""",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0

From the texture  we were very sure it was frozen and then thawed.   I ordered a rainbow roll and it took them 30 minutes to make it. Were they busy defrosting the fish in the kitchen???Hmm.   Finally the roll arrived and within 30 secs the waitress brought us the check. Alright   super SLOW to make the roll  but super quick to ask their customer to pay. The waitress even had that grumpy look on her when she dropped the bill  WTF!!   We had a large group so I didn't want to be nasty but restaurant like that should just be closed! The only reason for its existence is its location - students like us eat whatever. Btw  I don't even think the food is cheap. I got way better sushi at similar price in San Jose/Fremont.

Seriously  sushi is usually very expensive and one 5 piece roll could cost almost $8 and be a mere snack. However at Tako they give you 6-8 pieces and most rolls are between $3-8 (the more expensive ones are more fancy and more filling  plus they give you at least 8 pieces). The specialty rolls are around $8 but the California rolls I believe are only about $1.75 as are some of the vegetarian rolls. Others maki rolls like tekka maki or spicy salmon are around $3-4 for 8 pieces for most. Very good prices for sushi if you ask me! The sushi has always tasted very good and fresh to me and the male server is super nice. Gyoza and eggrolls are always really good and very well priced!

Situated in the space next to Fat Slice  Tako has really inexpensive combo lunches which will run about the same as a slice next door. I think at the time they were exclusively for Cal students but I was actually in high school when I frequented this place the most. Not a place I'd particularly credit for their fresh sashimi  they do have a good selection of rolls to please both the sushi newbie and sushi experimenter.

2ciUQ05DREauhBC3xiA4qw,3cs8yJcJ347niTA90eTNGw,1,3,6/23/2011,Tako doesn't judge me (too much) when I order 2 or 3 rolls to-go with one set of chopsticks and I appreciate that  I do. And I also appreciate their relatively cheap Lion King rolls although I admit that it's probably the only thing I still order  along with an occasional Baja roll when I'm feeling particularly ~adventurous~.   There's a reason for that: unfortunately  Tako is one of the few places in the world that has made a spicy tuna roll I did not enjoy. I didn't just not enjoy it -- I found it to be repulsively and disturbingly sweet/fruity. Maybe it was an off day  I don't know. How do you mess up a spicy tuna roll??? I used to order their popcorn salmon  but it's getting more and more bready and less and less... fishy. And their chicken karaage is kinda like a tasteless and oilier (is that possible?) version of the stuff you can get at a Chinese supermarket deli -- that is to say  not chicken karaage.   I'll give credit where credit is due though. Although on the sweeter side  their Lion King rolls reaaaaalllllyyyyy hit the spot.  I don't dig the Christian pop music that's on repeat  but I don't eat in that often. The food comes a lot more quickly if you just call them and pick up your order.,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
2ciUQ05DREauhBC3xiA4qw,Hq233gErQe72PzVAZxXPuA,1,3,2/11/2012,Ate at Tako once with 2 of my friends. I was surprised at how cheap the prices were and how the rolls looked proportional to their prices. I didn't have the chance to order the rolls  (only tried the CA roll  which tasted like any typical CA roll...) so we ordered the Donburi for around 4dollars  Kimchi Fried Rice for around 3dollars  and Chicken Teriyaki Boll w/ 4 CA rolls for around 6dollars. Pretty cheap for lunch  I may say. The Donburi was pleasing and full. The chicken was very crunchy and it seemed to have a sweet BBQ sauce to it. On top of that  they had rice on the bottom and a fried egg with vegetables in it. I would recommend getting it again if you stop by for a quick-fix for your hunger. The bowl isn't super big  but it isn't super small too. The Kimchi Fried Rice was good  but had too much of a sour and spicy taste. After eating half the rice  my friend got sick of it and we had to ditch the plate of rice. Maybe it was the fact that the rice didn't taste like it was made of Kimchi  and tasted more of a Mexican-styled rice? The Chicken Teriyaki Rice bowl was the same...Like any other  but also very fulfilling. However  there's much better sushi places out there who have bigger portions and cheaper rice bowls then what we ordered. The miso soup was salty  but we never had miso soup in our life so we didn't have a say in this. Overall  it was pretty alright  but I'll go back next time for the rolls to try it out instead of ordering entrees. The Starving Student Specials seem promising though  so I recommend Berkeley students to go there during lunch hours for a cheap  filling meal!,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0

I came here frequently for the seaweed salad  california roll  and spider roll before I became a sushi snob.  That being said  those things I just listed are still pretty okay here.  Other menu items i've tried: miso soup - i actually really like it here!  they always give you a bowl when you dine in. popcorn chicken - i was obsessed with these at one point in my life!  love them  and love the sauce.  they are crunchy  mushy  and spicy  all at the same time.  very tasty! tempura - pretty decent.  i like the dipping sauce. edamamme - good.  i mean  what else can i say about steamed soy beans? sashimi - leaves something to be desired.  Rolls: poki roll - i like it!  spicy tuna roll topped with seaweed salad.  i just really like poki. new york roll - not very memorable. philly roll - good. spider roll - the soft shell crab is soft  and it's topped with masago.  i really enjoy the spider roll here. spicy california roll - whoa  really spicy. oishii roll - pretty good. baja roll - pretty good also. stuffed oranges - spicy scallops wrapped with fresh salmon.  for some reason i expected more and was oddly disappointed. lion king roll - i really like this one.  baked salmon on top of california roll.  i think maybe it's the baked salmon and the sauce.  The people who work here are friendly.  They charge like $0.25 for extra hot sauce when you order take-out (uh  lame).  I only come in here once in a while now (during finals  and when i'm starving)  and I think they have new people working here.  They're not as nice as the people who have been working there for a long time.  Don't come in during peak hours.  Not only will it take forever for you to get your food (for both dine-in and take-out)  the service is super sucky (since there are so many people).  There's a $7 minimum for credit cards.

The food is  at it's worst  on par with what you pay. At it's best  this place is truly enjoyable.  I don't plug this place hardcore because I've only been here two times.

2ciUQ05DREauhBC3xiA4qw,od37sJ_bkgng2uDBavD_fA,1,3,3/13/2011,I'm not a sushi connoisseur  I usually get california rolls because for one  at Tako sushi they are ridiculously cheap. Like less than $2 for four of them  which  for a student  is a pretty good deal.  Their california rolls aren't bad which is why if it was just based on those and price this place would get five stars from me (their tempura isn't bad either).  HOWEVER  let's go through the list of things that kinda suck about this place:  1. The service. There is this one waitress who is hands down the surliest woman I have ever had the misfortune of coming into contact with. Every time me and my friends come or even if I drop in by myself this woman is just not friendly. I'm antisocial and awkward so my standards of friendliness are pretty low  basically if you seem nicer than me  you're friendly. I try to be nice to people who serve me my food because after all they're serving me  but this woman...I just don't get it  I smile  I get a blank stare from her  I try to catch her eye if our table needs something and she will look straight at me and turn her back and walk away O.O I always tip her well so I just don't understand it. BEWARE the mean asian lady  if you get a guy server you should be fine though  the bald asian guy with glasses is always super nice and efficient.  2. Don't get popcorn anything here. It's not like normal popcorn chicken  it's really mostly just composed of their fried batter  barely any meat if there's meat at all in it  and served with weird  gross [imo] sauce.  3. Over-priced Edammame. I've been to way better sushi places than this and the Edammame has never been so much for so little. I love Edammame I could eat it all day which is why it always makes me sad when I can't have it here.  4. If you're taking sushi to go be careful  the wait time can range anywhere from 3-20 minutes so it may not be a good idea for a fast sushi fix before class.,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0

This roll had so much flavor at such a good price that I almost cried... tears of JOY! AHHHH.  Plus they have such an extensive menu & vegetarian options so you can keep coming back for more! Also  they miso soup that comes with the roll is a nice touch. They even gave miso soup to my friends who didn't even order anything!

2ciUQ05DREauhBC3xiA4qw,jCPEuzA3I5JBhi8VPb-Naw,3,4,6/16/2012,The sushi is just okay  but the price is unbeatable! I'm not super picky with my sushi  and actually just enjoy the california rolls you can get at Costco. So I really don't have much to say about the quality of the rolls.  My favorites are the: - bay scallop   - dragon roll  and  - california rolls (when I'm not that hungry)  The bay scallop is baked so it takes a little longer for them to make  but everything in this goes together really well. It's essentially a california roll topped with scallops  this orange sauce  and masago. They're really generous with the masago  and soy sauce isn't really necessary  which makes it easier to eat :)  I do like coming here for sushi because it's cheaper  but my friends who are picky tend to stay away.,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0

If you come here with a sophisticated sushi palate expecting something more than Americanized sushi "" don't waste your time and money. You'll find tasty food here  but nothing even remotely authentic.  Almost everything I've tried has exceeded my expectations  especially for the price: bento boxes  chicken teriyaki  spring rolls  nigiri  and of course  the sushi rolls. The fish is surprisingly fresh -- in fact  this is where I had my first taste of raw fish  so it can't be that horrifying  right? Even their side dishes are great. The salad has a wonderful  unique dressing and the miso soup is always hot and yummy.  The classic California roll was my first experience with sushi  and I've never had a better California roll since. I prefer rolls with imitation crab salad as opposed to whole chunks of crab. I heard that they put sugar in the rice on the rolls  which disturbs me  but it does help explain why the rolls are so delicious. Most of the other assortments I've tried have also been orgasmic  particularly the Baja  Oishii  Sunrise  Dragon  Caterpillar  and Spider rolls. I like the mayonnaise-based sauces they drizzle on them  too. The combination of flavors are always great.  In addition to the amazing food  you'll barely be done with your soup before your entr\u00e9e arrives  and the waiters are very attentive  refilling your water as needed. The decor is great for a hole-in-the-wall  too. Cute paintings on the walls and non-ghetto tables.  The only disappointing item I've had was the potstickers  which were too crispy for my tastes  and if I recall correctly  they were served with a sauce that did not complement the taste well at all. Other minor negatives include the Christian music  which seems like subtle brainwashing and kind of creeps me out. I suppose this explains why they're closed Sunday. This also sucks  but as long as you make a mental note to not go on Sundays  it isn't a big deal at all. And finally  there's something inherently wrong with Mexican music coming from the kitchen of a Japanese restaurant. Then again  what the hell do I care who makes the food as long as it's good?  To summarize: HELLZ FUCKING YES. I've since had far more expensive sushi assuming I'll get what I pay for  but honestly I'd choose Tako Sushi over the overpriced alternatives any day of the week. I just moved to Sacramento and even the ""good"" Japanese restaurants up here don't live up to the legendary Tako Sushi. I'll always have my memories  I guess. Also  it took me awhile to figure this out  but you can order the same items from Nude Sushi (http://www.getnudesushi.com) and have them delivered to your door until 3 AM. I know it seems to good to be true  but it's no joke: you can enjoy Tako Sushi at almost any hour of the day! For those of us melting into the couch with a bad case of the munchies  I can't imagine anything better. Whoever thought of the concept of late-night delivery sushi is a genius  plain and simple.

The sushi is pretty good if you are a fan of sushi. However  after I was introduced to the magic of sashimi by my friend  sushi just seems bland. With that new perspective  I can only call Tako's sushi average. What can I say  I tend to prefer simplicity over the complex monstrosities that most sushi rolls have become. At the very least  Tako doesn't douse their rolls in soy sauce  avocado  tempura batter  and hot sauce.  Everything else is average as well.

My friend and I came here on a Friday noon for our lunch munch session. The seating is plentiful but cramped. We were given menus  water  and complimentary miso soup. We then ordered:  #71: CRUNCHY DELIGHT: shrimp tempura  crab  avocado  topped with crunchies [8 pieces | $7.99] - My favorite! Recommended by my friend as well. - I adored the crunchies (LOOOL)  and the pieces were filling! Avocado was decently fresh  and the crab was fairly tasty. The crab overpowered the shrimp tempura  though.  #29: CHICKEN TERIYAKI ROLL: BBQ chicken with avocado  topped with teriyaki sauce [8 pieces | $4.59] - My second favorite! Chicken is tasty  and the avocado is a good pair! Digging the teriyaki sauce with sesame seeds on top. Simple and cheap is the way to go!  #64: DYNAMITE ROLL: deep-fried spicy salmon  cucumber  topped with crab and spicy sauce [9 pieces | $9.59] - My least favorite. I wouldn't recommend it. - I liked that the roll was deep-fried  as the crispy outside complimented the softness of the rice and crab. But the salmon. It was gross. The texture was tough  and the spiciness was too sharp. You would bite into the crunchy shell  enjoy the crab piled on top  and then struggle to chew the resistant salmon filling. Dislike.  Our total before tax came to $24.11  which wasn't as cheap as what I anticipated. But  we came out full and satisfied. And we DID order a lot. What can I say  my friend is a glutton.  Good food (can't say anything about the freshness of fish though  since we only ordered cooked spicy salmon)  decent prices  kind of slow service (took about 12 minutes  although it was during the lunch hour)  and complimentary miso soup.

I'd recommend trying a roll that you haven't seen before that looks good to you  it's a nice change from your general sushi choices.  The nigiri is OK  but if you're looking for nigiri/sashimi  Tako isn't your place  their rolls are fine though.  Or if you're pretty hungry  look toward the starving student special  the chicken katsu curry is decent  and you get a ton!  Get that + a roll or two  and that's a pretty large meal that will fill you up =P,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
2crmRB4gANOKDX5tl-XYBw,QPKYotM5D1B-33Smcd0kXg,1,3,7/18/2007,My roommate and I  eager to get out of the scary new world of cooking our own food were lured in here by its spiffy logo and clean aesthetic  as well as its cheap looking menu.  As far as cheap Westwood food goes  you can do better  especially right here. Pastagetti is right in between D'Amore's and Noodle Planet  and across the street form Chicken Teriyaki Bowl  three excellent places to eat when on a student budget. Being right next to D'Amore's means there really isn't that good of a reason to go here if you want Italian food.  That said  the food wasn't bad  but not exactly memorable. I ordered a Caesar Salad and the Gnocci Pesto. The salad was bland and the lettuce didn't taste that crisp or fresh  but it was still a caesar salad. The pasta was more of a disappointment. The dish was essentially a soup of creamy pesto sauce with gnocci floating in it  and was pretty liquidy. It was not a terrifically appetizing entre  but I couldn't help but think how much better it would have been with a thicker sauce and less of it.  I can't really imagine going back here  mainly due to the other options so close by  but it's there. Just note that like Noodle Planet they do not take credit card  and the service is what you'd expect for an establishment at this price range.,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0

Then I tried their food and disappointment flooded my system. Hard to enjoy your meal when you're all flooded.. with disappointment.   Food: Picture what happens when an Asian run restaurant gives Italian pasta a go. My pink sauce (white cream based sauce + red tomato based) was an ungodly orange color with little taste. As for the pasta itself  it wasn't overcooked  but generally unmemorable otherwise. I only paid about $6.50 for the meal which included garlic bread (actually pretty tasty) and a pack of Eclipse gum stamped with the words sample pack."" I think that speaks for itself.   Atmosphere: Well lit and cheerfully dressed in red and check  the interior is welcoming and clean. It's a wonder more people don't eat in here. Okay  who am I kidding? The food is a total turn off that cannot be downplayed with nice decorating.  Service: Generally good. They whipped up my pasta quickly although I wouldn't have minded waiting an extra couple of minutes for a better tasting meal.

Everything is customizable -- from size (individual to large)  crust (gluten and wheat options)  sauce (from tomato to pesto to hoisen to ranch  etc!)  cheese  spices  AND toppings. See the full list here: http://extremepizza.com/menu/createyourown.html  OR  You can order one of their themed Extreme Pizzas"" where they have all types of pizzas for whatever mood you might be in for: Italian  Veggie  Mediterranean  Mexican  South  etc. I tried Pandora's Box -- sauceless pizza with spinach  artichoke hearts  sun dried tomatoes  feta and other spices. It was made to order  with a fairly thin crust and tons of toppings. I got tomato sauce on the side (no charge) and it had a bit of zing to it that was pretty tasty. I ended up dipping the crust into the sauce (normally not a crust person).   It's a little too premature to say if I'm a fan of this place. I devoured the pizza but then again  I was really really hungry at the time. I like the concept here a LOT better than CPK  but I'm not a fan of CPK in the first place.

2h_d-JP8l56FuVcEj4aVig,e1hWeNPW_WIM1mTAv7YnCw,1,2,2/9/2012,I tried out Extreme Pizza a couple times when it opened in spring 2011 and stopped in again this evening on the way back from the gym. I won't be coming here again. At 9 pm there was one table of 4 people who had already been served. I was told that my pizza to go would take about 10 minutes. Instead when I checked back after 20 minutes of waiting  I found that my pizza had not even gone in the oven yet because it had been bumped for several slices for someone who'd come in after me. When I complained  the guy blew me off without so much as an apology. I still can't believe that it took 25 minutes to make a pizza when I was the only person placing an order  nor that they bumped my pizza for someone who came in after me.    Regarding the pizza itself  the tomato sauce tasted metallic and the crust was leathery by the time I'd gotten it home  10 minutes later. To add injury to the insult  I had ordered one of their veggie pizzas with added pepperoni--for which I was charged. I was unable to find any pepperoni on the pizza when I got home.   The inordinately long wait also led me to examine the kitchen area behind the counter for the first time. Instead of an actual pizza oven--much less a wood-fired brick oven--the pizzas here are baked in a glorified version of those conveyor-belt toasters they use in cafeterias. Small wonder the crust left something to be desired.   I had experienced mediocre service the previous couple of times I'd been here  but had put that down to lunchtime rush and the newness of the staff. The pizza was ok and they had some interesting options for toppings. They've now been open nearly a year  but I was treated with casual rudeness and not given the toppings that I was charged for.   If you still want to go  it's basically a lunch counter masquerading as a pizzeria/sports bar. There are several large-screen TVs mounted on the wall showing various sports games. You order at a counter from a list of pizzas that are more exciting in concept than in execution  and then you wait for a fairly long time to have your pizza brought to the table.   The location is not great  as it's easy to walk past without noticing. I can only imagine that the recent opening of 800 Degrees Pizza a couple blocks away is going to hurt. I'll be sticking to 800 Degrees in the future  or make the trek down to Pitfire if I want the more exotic toppings.  update: The manager contacted me after reading this review  to apologize and to investigate. It seems that my pizza was accidentally sent out with the delivery courier  and so they were making a second pizza for me--though without an explanation and forgetting that I'd paid for extra pepperoni. The manager seems very concerned  which makes me hopeful that my experience was an isolated incident.,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
2h_d-JP8l56FuVcEj4aVig,FKxG6f2Rrqxq-s_HiOH6Ew,1,3,7/18/2011,I stumbled upon Extreme Pizza completely by accident  and it's a nice space with your standard pizzas but they also have some slightly unusual toppings like hummus  black bean & salsa  shredded pork and a few others.  I ordered my standard Canadian bacon & mushroom  so that I could make a true apples-to-apples comparison.  I got the lunch special that comes with salad  pizza & drink for $8.  The salad is nothing special  and your dressing comes in a small cup on the side.  The pizza tasted OK to me - a slightly industrial crust and nice toppings  but overall it's nothing better or worse than what I could make at home.  I think a neighborhood comparison is fair in this case  and Enzo's has a thinner  crisper crust and better-tasting sauce  so I'm rating down slightly.  I checked the bottom of the pizza and it was well-browned  so I'm not talking about whether the pizza stayed in the oven long enough.  It's just a matter of the way it bakes up.  The people behind the register are friendly  and it's a very clean restaurant with nice LG flatscreen TVs and self-service drinks.  The menu also includes calzones  sandwiches  hot wings and a few other items but I'm so-so on the pizza.  Next time  probably going to Enzo's.,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1
2h_d-JP8l56FuVcEj4aVig,cp5rGaxt7kOL6oFFydrUMA,2,3,3/5/2012,My boss treated me and my fellow coworkers to lunch here on a Friday  and the restaurant was not very crowded. It's a relatively small place with just a few tables  and can fit a few groups of 2-3 people. Don't think about coming here with a big crowd; there won't be enough tables unless you combine every table in the restaurant.  Awesome/creative pizza names  alright pizza. We tried the Everest (meaty pizza) and the Pandora's Box (veggie pizza with artichokes). Both were kind of greasy  and the flavors of the meaty Everest overpowered the veggie because it was so salty and was like a meat party in your mouth (sausages/pepperoni/salami combined)! The Everest was pretty good though. Unfortunately  the pizza was relatively pricey. Large pizzas are about $20  and come with about 8-10 slices. They are also thin crust.   The hot wings they have here are pretty typical. Baked  not battered and fried. But it was pretty soft. Would've liked more wing sauce though.  Since it's more of a to-go restaurant  don't expect much service other than the servers taking your orders at the register and bringing your food.   For parking  you can probably find metered parking around the area or near the Trader Joe's lot. Parking's usually a nightmare in Westwood anyways  so good luck with that!

The original chicken and mac n' cheese alone would keep me coming back. I enjoy the tangy  smokey sauce that they slather their chicken in. It's truly like none other. You can also tell that the chickens they use weren't injected with GH since the legs and thighs I had were pretty slim and not over sized or plump. My 3 piece dark meat combo also came with 1 side so I went with the mac n' cheese which is pretty good and never disappoints... It's baked and the best part about it is the golden brown crispy top layer. The cheese clings onto the mac and is never runny while the macaroni is cooked perfectly.  I would have tried a different side such as their red roasted potatoes  green beans  or mushrooms  but I was disgusted to see that majority of the sides on the steam table were DRY and SHRIVELED from sitting their for hours under the heat lamp. I seriously don't understand how they don't notice this and simply replace the sides in time for dinner because everything besides the mac n' cheese and rice looked nasty and inedible.

She is there on alternate weeks; on her off weeks  her ex-husband  Palaka Sauer of Govinda's Gardens (catering  cooking classes) serves his own excellent vegan International fare (mainly Indian/Italian/Greek).

Here are the hours from her web site:    Monday: Closed Tuesday: Lunch - 12-3:00pm Wednesday: Lunch - 12-3:00pm  Dinner - 5-9:00pm Thursday: Lunch - 12-3:00pm  Dinner - 5-9:00pm Friday: Lunch - 12-3:00pm  Dinner - 5-9:00pm (*some Fridays are Brazilian night and Dinner is 6:30-9:30 - check the website for dates on Brazilian night) Saturday: Lunch - 12-3:00pm Sunday: Brunch - 12-4:00pm  We have had Vraja's food at the Farmer's Market several times  and it is very good  although it seems expensive for what you get ($7 for one entree  or $12 for a plate with three dishes).  We have visited her restaurant  but we have not managed to get there when they were open and serving food.

You'll walk out feeling satisfied and happy.  ======== Vraja's food always rocks. A visit to her cafe can be a bit confusing for first-timers. So  for those of you ready to try it for the first time  here are some tips.  It's a tiny place. Seating is limited. You might bump butts with strangers trying to get into your chair. But to Vraja  there are no strangers. Adopt that attitude.  Don't go there in a hurry. Dining at Vraja's is like dropping in on a friend. Grab a seat  feel free to pour yourself a cup of water or kombucha tea from the counter. When Vraja has a minute  she'll come out to help you.   At Vraja's you get what you get. The menu changes based on what she feels like cooking due to what's in season  what looked fresh when she was shopping  or what she felt like making. So just order the plate"" and you're guaranteed a great meal with international flair.  Enjoy the food. Chill. Take time to taste it. Vraja is a pro at combining flavors.   When you're done  just walk up to the register and pull out your wallet. She accepts cash and local checks only. No credit cards  no debit cards  no ATM. It may take a while for her to get around to taking your money  so bring your cup up with you and have a few sips while you look at the art on the walls.  Bottom line: The food is awesome: flavorful  healthful and wholesome. The kombucha tea is delicious. Vraja is full of good vibes. The service is unusual.

The only thing common is that it is a burger. Every establishment serves them differently..  My Personal take is this: For $5-7 range  you won't find a burger that will satisfy your taste buds in this location. They don't charge extra for any toppings. The menu is VERY simple  and you really can't go wrong. If I could describe the burger  it is a mix between In N Out and Fatburger. For lunch  if you're craving a well put together burger and fast  look no further.  Again  all bias aside  there is NO reason at all to rate this place a 2 or 3 stars. The service was even great.

For that price we got a small side salad  side of tempura battered mixed veggies  a very large portion of white rice  our respective entrees (tofu and bulgolgi) and a drink. Not bad  right? Expect everything was bland and soggy. It definitely looked and smelled appetizing when I opened the box  but the first few bites proved otherwise. The salad was warm and the lettuce not crisp. The dressing was standard  out of a bottle. The tempura was a mix of bell peppers  green beans  and some broccoli. And they were soggy. The rice was soggy  cooked with too much water. The tofu was bland. It was drizzled with a soy/teriyaki sauce  and sprinkled with sesame seeds. The tofu should have been marinated  but it wasn't. I tried a little bit of my friend's bulgolgi  which was such a thin serving on top of the rice. That was better and more flavorful. But for $9  not worth it.

Specializing as a grab-n-go type of place  they offer all kinds of fairly healthy + homemade sandwiches  soups  + salads at the back counter plus coffees + teas in the front bar. Their location was renovated over from a truck loading dock  but they kept some elements it to contribute to the theme of the eatery such as using the actual docks as booths to eat in. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2QHWjWFnmyaRnCZTZLmFsQ?select=dnj7gIGpHb-drCNw5TvFzQ  Definitely a very industrial  cement look + feel. The decor still seems to be a work in progress as they were pulling new stools out of boxes when I was there  but it looks pretty cool. On the far wall they have a projected tv on the wall on a sports channel.   When I stopped by last week  I got their Pacific Rim Chicken Salad ($6) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2QHWjWFnmyaRnCZTZLmFsQ?select=Df1EJUgjld-D-eP9w8VcXg  while my friend got a Turkey Sandwich (plus bacon) w/ chips + a soda ($5.99) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2QHWjWFnmyaRnCZTZLmFsQ?select=Sk53x3N5FYgayP6k4ZZWpQ. Mine was alright... I really like how they asked about what I did + didn't want in my salad so that it really was custom-made in front of me  but even then  it came out kind of flavorless. I didn't get any mandarin oranges slices  which they'd said were in my selected salad. Neh. Oh well. My friend's sandwich was part of their $5.99 lunch special including a deli sandwich  bag of chips + a medium drink. She said hers was okay  too  but I believe it was probably at least a better value than mine was.   Their location is a couple blocks east of campus to serve the USC administration + services buildings that are out in that area. While beneficial to those employees  it's kind of a far trek for students considering the food isn't uber unique or amazing. There's similar options on campus already that would be more convenient but also likely to be pre-packaged rather than customizable. They take either cash  card or USC discretionary funds. One cool thing about URBNMRKT is FREE valet parking! Sure I realize that they kind of have to offer valet since there literally is NO parking on that stretch of S. Grand  but it's always nice to have someone open your door for you.   =),1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1

If you follow them on Facebook they list all of their great specials including 2 for 1 coffee drinks in the morning! They have a wider variety of drinks than any coffee place I have been too. Plus this place has a very awesome ambiance! It used to be an old loading dock and the decor makes it look like an urban outfitters restaurant. The customer service is a lot better now that they hired new cashiers and I blame the old cashier for the bad service. If you had a bad experience come back again now it is sooo much better!

But the decor and theme"" are fun  and I think reflect some of the changes going on at USC Hospitality. They have mostly sandwiches and salads and changing specials displayed on a chalkboard. The roast beef sandwich with onions and dijon was great and I think I'll go for the pulled pork next time. Other than that  the sides and drinks are pretty standard.

For starters  the quality of the food is good  though it tastes very institutional...as expected from an uber clean  shiny stainless steel cladded modern 'assembly-line' of a kitchen. My fav is the lunch special  a turkey sandwich with bacon & avocado  a bag of chips and a fountain drink for 5.99  not bad  considering you can pay the same for a meal at most fast food joins in the vicinity. Though the sandwich is good  what keeps me coming back  is the friendly service  the comfortable ambience with free wifi  the comfy couches  the plush 'urban' feel and decor  and the complimentary valet service (though i usually ride my bike there  it's nice to know the valet is there) as well as a safe haven from the lunch mobs raiding all of the campus eateries during lunch time. Give this place a try  if not for the food  at least for the experience; after all the name does the place justice  for URBNMRKT could comfortably fit into a real urban"" setting of New York  Chicago  and even downtown LA!

I orded a pulled pork bbq sandwich for something around $5 (the price was certainly right)  and although the man behind the counter won me over with his charm  the pork was too fatty  the sauce tasted bottled and the bread was stale.

And customizable with an array of frostings and toppings. They aren't big  but they're definitely filling.  My favorite frostings are Almond and Hazelnut  and personally I like pairing them with fresh fruit toppings otherwise the rolls can be too sweet. We got a Almond blueberry roll and the daily special roll (which was hazelnut frosting  chocolate syrup  and gingersnap topping)  and the Almond blueberry roll was a lot better because the daily special was just too thick/sweet with the added chocolate syrup. So if the daily special is something that has a lot of sugar on it  I would recommend just creating your own roll.  Unfortunately  it seems like they've raised their prices  because the daily specials are now $5  and a customizable roll starts at $4.75... Definitely worth a visit though!,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0

You'll be even more appreciative if you're Vegan and the only taste of Cinnabon that you've had is from the sweet cinnamon essence that permeates every mall that it's located in.   Even if you're not Vegan  Cinnaholic is better in every way with it's exquisitely homemade flavor coupled with perfectly baked dough. Just sweet and delectable enough without knocking you into a diabetic coma. Come to think of it  comparing the two is doing Cinnaholic an injustice. The student has become the master. It is that good!  The daily special is always a good bet since it's a dollar less from their other specialty rolls. Or if you prefer  you can create your own masterpiece utilizing the variety of toppings available.   I'm not sure it really matters what the topping is  I'm pretty sure you'll leave satisfied unless you happen to be an insatiable dessertaholic. These large doughy morsels are addictive! Whatever trouble you may get into after devouring one of these bad boys  Cinnaholic should not be held liable.   Service isn't overly friendly but it's sufficient. No bathroom that I saw and there's only a few chairs outside. Its probably a better grab 'n go option so you can hit up a coffee shop and savor it there.

I went in and had a cinnamon roll and it was the BEST cinnamon roll I have EVER had.  This is the platonic ideal of what a cinnamon roll is supposed to be.  I didn't even know this was a vegan shop until I went in there the second or third time and saw the logo.  I was AMAZED because I would have sworn there was butter or cream cheese in the lush vanilla frosting.  I want to know what's in there!  (I am a total omnivore.)  I have no idea what the vegan below who says these are sub par vegan sweets has been smoking because I have never had a vegan dessert this good (and  while I'm not a vegan  I'm adventurous and eat all kinds of food including vegan food).  Unfortunately  I'm being tested for celiac disease and I might have to go gluten free.  If Cinnaholic had a gluten free option I would be greatly comforted because I can figure out how to bake the stuff I make myself but I wouldn't have the first idea how to duplicate these cinnamon rolls!

Sure the place is cool looking but how can a vegan cinnamon roll be any good?  Without the use of any animal products like egg and butter won't it be tasteless?   Well butter my butt with soy-butter and call me a vegan biscuit! These cinnamon rolls were really good! You can customize whatever flavor your heart desires but with so many options we figured just order from the specialty menu. We had the apple specialty and the smores one. Fresh apple sprinkled on top of crumbles for one roll was definitely a plus. Chocolate and marshmallow on the other - how can you lose?   Now I'm not saying their cinnamon rolls are like a Cinnabon or anything - but they are pretty tasty for being vegan! Cinnaholic made me a believer that vegan food can taste good.

Vegans must be ecstatic that they don't have to settle for an inferior product (not that Vegan baked goods are inferior -in fact  I often prefer them).

However  the frosting is really tasty and it is pretty fun that you can customize your cinnamon roll with all sorts of flavors and toppings. I ordered one with almond flavoring added and fresh raspberries. Divine!  They also have specialty cinnamon rolls and I also ordered one of these (chocolate chip cookie dough).

None of the specialty flavors really appealed to me  so I went with the Old Skool (classic).  Temp: Must eat warm.

AMBIANCE:  Forgive me  but I'm about to be snarky:  Ambiance. What ambiance?  Cinnaholic is a teeny tiny shop (and why should they be any bigger  they sell cinnamon rolls?).  A couple of tables  a refrigerator with bottled drinks  a counter  and a glass display case demonstrating cinnamon rolls at their finest hour.    Pay by debit card and you'll sign your name on their  that's right  iPad.  This is just before you'll eat your cinnamon roll with your hands (well  we did because we weren't given silverware and I didn't see any lying around).  Have the folks at Cinnaholic not heard about e coli having spread in New York by people touching the iPads on display?    Also  I'd just like to say  Cinnaholic  meet the Swiffer Duster.  Swiffer Duster  meet Cinnaholic.""  It's time to dust this restaurant!  It's a tiny place  but you can't be bothered to clean the light fixtures or window sills?  Wiping down tables  ever heard of it?   MENU:  The menu is divinely simple.

FOOD:  As for me  I devoured an almond frosted cinnamon roll topped with strawberry slices (this was my breakfast - yikes!).  I don't think I'll ever be able to find another cinnamon roll that will satisfy me in the same manner as this one.  And it's all vegan! ---- On a side note  it's a good thing the cinnamon roll was finger-lickin'-good because there wasn't a napkin in sight (I finally discovered a small stack of them tucked away near the register  but this was after I'd finished my meal.   SERVICE:  The girl behind the Cinnaholic counter seemed visibly displeased that we had entered the door.  She never smiled and offered zero enthusiasm.  No one asked what we thought of our cinnamon roll  we weren't asked if we needed anything like silverware - napkins - or something to drink  and there was no 'thank you!' as we walked out the door. Quite frankly  I got the impression they were happy to see us leave.      PRICE:  Almost $5.00 for the most epic cinnamon roll you've ever eaten. Worth it!""",1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0

There was an extremely long line  so we were a bit confused why everyone decided to go there that day  but we found out that it was Cinnaholic's 1 year anniversary!   As part of their anniversary celebration  they were selling their Old Skools(normal vanilla cinnamon rolls) for $1!!! Super cheap considering it's normally $4.50 for one  and $3.75 with your student ID.  We got one Old Skools eat  and made our own because cmon  we were there for our first time! We got one with macademia nut frosting and chocolate chips. Our macademia nut-choco chip one was a bit too sweet for me -- there were way too many chocolate chips  and when it's hot  it melted all over the bun and made it too chocolate-y. The macademia nut was just okay. Still sweet  but couldn't taste the nut part too much.  I liked the Old Skool more because it was less sweet  but all in all  this place didn't hit it for me. Although it's vegan  I felt like I could tell because it wasn't as rich and the dough itself was a bit too bland. I wish the roll had more cinnamon with it  and less frosting.   Not sure if it'll come back for a $4 cinnamon roll  but definitely will be back if they have another anniversary deal next year!,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0

Everything I ever wanted in a cinnamon roll  and being vegan it seemed lighter than most others do.  Granted  they seem to compensate for the lack of dairy products with sugar and uh...more sugar  but if you have more sugar in your blood than blood and have the diet of a hummingbird like me (eating marshmallows as a snack  etc.) then you should LOVE this place.

Cinnamon rolls tend to be too sweet for me but the s'more cinnamon roll I had at Cinnaholic had just the perfect level of sweetness (I personally love s'more flavored foods though  so I may be biased fyi). The bun itself was soft and nicely toasted and the frosting+chocolate chip+graham cracker+marshmallow toppings made every bite truly special and unique. It was surprisingly not too sweet with all the frosting and chocolate. Instead  it was a nice morning treat to start off my study date and it paired really well with my White Chocolate Mocha from Starbucks. I plan on customizing my own roll next time  so I'll just award Cinnaholic 3 stars for now. Maybe more stars to come after I try all that they have to offer. No matter what though  I still recommend the s'more cinnamon roll!   Oh oh  remember to show your student ID for a DISCOUNT and sometimes they have samples on the high tables outside the store.

I know vegan cinnamon rolls CAN be done well  because I've made delicious ones at home  but I worry that non-vegans who try Cinnaholic will think their veganness is the reason for their blandness.  The major problems I had with this place were: 1. The dough was dry and exceedingly bland. 2.

If you don't get that joke  you won't get the charm of this place.  Cinnaholic is the non-greasy  non-buttery  sweet but not sugary version of the classic cinnamon bun.    The space itself is small  but not cluttered and very clean.  There's a cooler full of drinks  and a food wrap with sample cinnamon rolls and the creation station.  There is a student discount available  but I opted for the Oreo concoction.  Oh  it was a grand day.  The cinnamon bun itself was warm  and was somewhat light on cinnamon.  That was a good thing though  because of all the epic toppings.  The Oreo concoction consisted of vanilla icing  milk chocolate chips  and Oreo chunks.    HOLY EFFING TOLEDO it was insane.  I notoriously have a sweet tooth  and this was beyond satisfying.  Also  it also happens to be vegan  which pleased my anti-meat bestie.    I capped mine off with a chocolate Silk soy milk drink  and the whole package was about seven bucks  which is a little pricey  but after having it inside of me  it was totally worth it (minds out of the gutter  people).

I haven't had cinnamon rolls in years due to the fact that I am vegan and it doesn't have the best healthy rep.

The bun itself was sooooo fresh and gooey and warm. Not only are their classic buns fantastic  but you can pick from a VARIETY of toppings and frostings. Vanilla frosting with coconut and blackberries was our favorite. We can not wait to return.    We only wish that they were open past 7pm as we want this for DESSERT  and that parking in that area was easier (obviously this is beyond Cinnaholic's control).

With a student discount though  it goes down to about $3.5. In my opinion  Cinnaholic needs to lower their prices a bit: poor college students looking for a snack have better options  like Cream at $2.00 a sandwich. Even for a few dollars more  you could actually buy a whole meal.   Anyways  going on with the review  my friend and I got a roll with Irish creme and hazelnuts. I am reluctant to pluralize the hazelnuts since there were exactly 2  count them  hazelnut on the cinnamon roll. The icing itself was pretty bland. I couldn't really taste the Irish cream flavor. It's pretty disappointing seeing how they make their frosting. They take plain frosting  and just add in some liqueur. Bleh. I can get artificial flavors anywhere. They don't ice the roll generously either  so once you're through with the frosting on top  don't expect the rest of your roll to be sweet. More on that in the next paragraph.  The cinnamon roll itself is of non-rising roll variety. The roll was soft on the inside  and had a crust like that of a dinner roll. I definitely prefer the kind of cinnamon rolls that are made to rise. The inside of the cinnamon roll lacks definitely lacks butter  cinnamon  and sugar -- quite disappointing. For $5.00  I expect nothing but perfection! Without the icing  a cinnamon roll from here might taste similar to a dinner roll.  The rolls themselves are not the freshest. Due to business not being too good  there's a high probability that only one batch of cinnamon rolls are made and the same rolls sit in the display case all day until an order comes along. As a inevitable result  the rolls themselves dry out a lot. The icing saves the top of the roll by overwhelming the dryness but beyond the top couple centimeters of the roll  the dryness and staleness is very evident.  In terms of atmosphere  I have mixed opinions. They use a credit card reader attached to an iPad for their cash register"" which was really cool  first time I've seen that  but then the people working in the store weren't the best suited for the job. It's not that they didn't smile  but the guy who made my cinnamon roll looked he was going for the world record for simultaneously having the most tattoos and piercings at one time. I'm all for no discrimination in hiring  but I feel like my experience would've been better if I had been served by somebody else.  I highly recommend other places for cinnamon rolls.""",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

My idea of the perfect cinnamon roll is: -A lot of cinnamon and icing. -Crusty outer shell that is still fluffy and moist on the inside. The deeper you go the more ooey-gooey it should get. -Best straight out of the oven.  Cinnaholic's cinnamon roll is: -Has a very limited amount of cinnamon along with a thick serving of icing. -Very soft. Imagine the consistency of a regular glazed or sugar donut. -Sitting under a warming lamp.  I had the daily special which was a cinnamon roll with banana frosting  blackberries  and ginger snaps. The flavor combination doesn't work at all and the big pieces of ginger snaps were overkill. The banana frosting tasted almost exactly like banana flavored Laffy Taffy.  Cinnaholic's cinnamon roll is still enjoyable as long as you imagine it's a donut instead of what's supposed to be a cinnamon roll. I didn't get the sugar crash like I do at Cinnabon; yet  I still would have preferred that experience  ____  Kinda felt like the same way I did when I saw Cinnaholic's poster of Johnny Cash flipping the bird.""",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

After one bite of the Old Skool roll  I was like wow quit playin'...is this stuff seriously vegan? It was just so good  I didn't even need to slather any frosting on it for it to be delicious. We ordered it with the frosting on the side  which I recommend for those who like to control how gooey and sweet their rolls should be. The bun was nice and warm with just the right amount of cinnamon. The Oreo Explosion roll was topped with oreo bits  chocolate sauce  mini chocolate chips  and their regular frosting. With all those extras it was of course more decadent and probably better to share (I could probably eat a few Old Skool rolls by myself).   The only qualm I have about Cinnaholic was that they were understaffed so the wait was a bit long (one girl handling several orders). Nevertheless  the rolls ended up being worth the wait  and the girl who was working was totally sweet and competent given the circumstances.

They had frostings and toppings for 25 cents each  which ranged from all sorts of fruity  nutty  and sweetish.   They operate on an ipad  random fact  which I though was adorable!  So here are our creations (comes to about $5 each):  Pina colada frosting with strawberries & raspberries. LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED.  Cream soda frosting with apples & candy cane. Doesn't really taste like cream soda  and wasn't very frostingy... but very interesting mixture. Candy cane bits were sort of dangerous if you chomp down the rolls...  Strawberry frosting with raspberries & graham crackers. Kiddish treat  the graham crackers are more like chunks of cookies though  not the actual crackers.  Hazelnut frosting with almonds and raspberries. ALMONDS are such a nice touch! Can't really taste the hazelnut of the hazelnut frosting though.

No lines  no crowds  and a very sterile sparse feeling inside.   I was overwhelmed by the rolls on display and by the menu too. There were a few other people in there with me also looking overwhelmed by the menu and all its choices. Two people even walked out after trying some samples.The woman behind the counter was just waiting for SOMEONE in the place to make a decision. tap  tap  tap. At least the other person behind the counter was working on getting fresh rolls out of the oven.   I finally got brave and settled on two rolls- one was a specialty with cream soda frosting and a cherry  the other was a regular roll with caramel apple frosting. Served to go in a biodegradable container (woo!)  I then drove an hour to friends that I could share these calorie bombs with. They sat for some more time before we finally dove in.   Seriously  this stuff hurt the sides of my jaw  you know  inside where you get that twang when something is sour or too sweet. This was just the first bite. Then things dulled down and I was able to enjoy. I actually really liked the caramel apple frosting and the roll itself. The cream soda frosting was good as well but the cherry on top was waaay too sweet to consume. My friends also enjoyed the rolls but in small bites  over time. They have a demonstrated slighter sweet tooth than I.  Because the rolls had been sitting for some time in the container I think that caused some slight hardness on the edges of the roll.   All in all I really liked the product and I'm anxious to try one again that's still warm and a new flavor. In fact  yeah tomorrow you might find me sitting at one of those cool chrome tables they got outside.,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

It's a simple bakery where you can make your own cinnabon with a huge variety of sauces and toppings  or you can just get one of their pre-set styles (the varieties change by the day).  I had a chocolate chip cookie dough cinnabon ($5) and man was it good. Soft  delicious bun  with a sweet (but not sickly sweet) sauce and chunks of cookie dough on top.  It must have been close to 1 000 calories  but how often do you get vegan cinnabons? And this thing was high grade.  My only gripes: the service is kind of slow as they carefully make each cinnabon to-order; there's not much seating (it's designed more for grab-and-go); and their tea offerings are unimpressive (generic bagged varieties  rather than loose-leaf).  I can't wait to go back and try some new toppings (chocolate and hazelnut come to mind).,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

Cinnaholic is right  cause at this point I'm addicted to these delectable delights.  The second I took my first bite of my chocolate chip flavored roll I fell instantly in love.  To know I had even more flavors to choose from made me deliriously giddy.  Now I just want to play with the possibilities.

The creative name  the beautifully made menu board  and the numerous types of icings toppings and rolls...it all sums up to a winner! The people are also friendly and willing to help with your order.  I came here to get a roll for my friend and I  and we both agree that they were good. The two rolls we ordered were: (1) An old-fashion roll with strawberry icing and raspberry toppings  and (2) an old-fashion roll with lime icing and lime toppings.  Another ace in the hole they have at Cinnaholic is their student discount! Instead of paying about $4.25 for a roll  it is only $3 a piece. And with each topping and icing choice only $0.25 each...WHAT A STEAL!! In total  two rolls with one icing and topping each cost $8.  I was also amazed at how they use the Apple Square as their cash register. It is convenient  and you are able to receive your receipts by email.

A few years ago I made a vegan chocolate cake and it was awful  so I swore off anything vegan  ESPECIALLY vegan desserts. BUTTER IS MY BEST FRIEND  GUYS. After much deliberation  I made an exception last year to try Neatloaf"" at Ananda Fuara in the Tenderloin and I hated that too.  NO MORE VEGAN  I told myself.   So this is what happened when I discovered Cinnaholic:  (Realizing that this place sells custom cinnamon rolls and is only a few miles away from me)  *I'M SO EXCITED!*  (Clicking on the website)  *I'M SO EXCITED!*  (Seeing that it's a VEGAN cinnamon roll place)  *I'M SO...SCARED.*  Where's Zack Morris to hug when you need him? Dreams. Crushed.  I was no longer excited to try this place. The yelp reviews were so good  but they had wronged me before when I got suckered into trying that awful ""neatloaf"" in the city. ""DON'T BE A SUCKER! Vegan means no flavor and weird textures! "" I told myself.  But then I saw that they had a deal on Living Social and that bargain-loving gene that comes programmed into all Asians overcame me  and I bought a voucher. Two rolls for $5. That's a darn good deal  no?  So  as devout lovers of cinnamon rolls  boyfriend and I made the trip to Cinnaholic  expecting to be underwhelmed by these cinnamon rolls. At that point  I had forgotten that they were vegan  and while looking at the extensive icing list  I kept thinking to myself  ""WHERE IS THE CREAM CHEESE?!"" Then I remembered that it's a vegan bakery  and then I kicked myself again for buying the deal and probably let out a big sigh inside the middle of the bakery.   Boyfriend ordered the chocolate chip cookie dough  I got the special of the day  which was a caramel apple pie cinnamon roll. We came  we saw  we hesitated  we ate.  And we loved it. Boyfriend logged into his phone and bought another voucher on the spot. These rolls were fluffy and delicious  and I didn't miss any animal byproducts at all. Whoda thunk?

Maybe it's the vegan style  but the cinnamon buns were not baked until brown. From a pastry perspective it's consistency was like a dinner roll. The cinnamon flavor was lacking and substituted with a bland sweet flavor. Perhaps this is intentional so they can up-sell their toppings (I got strawberries and pecans.)

In fact  you want something filling and SWEET too  but you don't want a bag of candy (AKA pure sugar) from GBC  a tiny slice of cheesecake from a cafe  a cup of goopy froyo  or a package of preservative-filled cookies from Walgreens. What you should do  my friend  is head over to Cinnaholic!  I tried this place for the first time today and the experience was unforgettable! The staff here are so incredibly nice and the food was so good that I've vowed to stop by here every chance that I get!   I asked the girl at the cash register if their plastic-wrapped giant chocolate chip cookies (read: 5.5 inch diameter!) and brownies (also generously sized) had nuts in them since I have a nut allergy. When she assured me that they didn't  I decided to go all out (!!!) and order a cookie  a brownie  AND an Old Skool cinnamon roll! She was wonderfully considerate and asked if I was highly sensitive to nuts (which I am not  thankfully) because there is potential for cross-contamination and she even informed the girl preparing my order about my allergy so that she would change gloves and use a new  untouched tub of frosting.   As I was waiting for my roll  I asked a bunch of questions and got all of them answered! Here's what I learned: Normally  Oreos aren't vegan because they contain sugar that has been processed with animal bone char  but the kind they use here for the toppings is animal-free! Bags of their vegan air-puffed marshmallows are available for purchase so vegans can finally have marshmallows in their hot chocolate at home! Cinnaholic bakes all of their pastries at the store  so what you're eating is FRESH. They use an egg-replacer for eggs and soy-based products for anything that's traditionally dairy.   Now  on to the FOOD REVIEW! They're really got a magic touch here for baking vegan here! The Old Skool cinnamon roll was to DIE FOR and totally worth the $4.50! My fork cut through the warm  chewy fluffiness easily and each bite was ladened with the melty sweetness of indulgent frosting. There was actually too MUCH frosting (no stinginess here!)  and I had to throw away my to-go container with a heaping tablespoon of frosting left over. Most importantly  the SIZE of the entire roll was substantial enough to make me feel nice and satisfied afterwards. The brownie had just the right amount of chocolatey chewiness (unlike the dry vegan brownie from Smart Alec's) while the cookie was crisp on the outer edge and delightfully chewy in the middle! Though I'm not a vegan  I have eaten a lot of vegan pastries since I'm dairy-free and egg-free and this stuff charts right at the TOP of the competition in taste  texture  and size.   Love this place  love the staff  and LOVE this great new way to alleviate my between-class cravings!,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1

Anyway  I got the Old Skool"" one which is just a regular roll with vanilla frosting and I got another one with maple frosting and pecan toppings. Both of them were soooooo good.

Warm soft cinnamon buns topped with your choice of icing and topping for ~$4-5. They have a wide selection of cookies  fruits  chocolate chips  marshmallows  etc. I went with the daily special cinnamon roll ($4) which was topped with vanilla icing  drizzled chocolate  chocolate chips  marshmallows  and graham crackers. It was good but also made me feel really unhealthy.  The toppings are really great  but the roll itself isn't that special. They heat up your roll when you order it  but mine cooled down really fast and could've been a little hotter. I wish they would have mini-cinnamon rolls for those of us who can't finish a giant cinnamon bun or don't want to pay over $3 for dessert  Service is good  the employees greet you the moment they walk through the door.

Very good location near UCB  so we were surprised to find them empty at 9:30 on a weekend. I can see the brand they're going after... austere mod vibe  spare shop space with a nearly-bare preparation space  unmarked black boxes. Vegan cinnabons aimed at creating a modern  almost ironic experience of a comfort treat. Here's the problem: I like my 80s music dark and ironic; I like my comfort treats to be comfortable  cozy  and inviting.  All the base buns are the same. We purchased four different icing flavors  and didn't find a wide range of experience. All of the icings were pretty uniform in their hyper-sweetness. This isn't a gripe about hyper-sweetness  it's a way of pointing out that they could easily narrow their selection by 2/3 because they aren't that different. The buns were pretty good  a little dense and not very flaky or fluffy. People look for different things in a cinnamon bun  I know. Not as cravenly decadent as Cinnabons  but then you set the bar lower for Cinnaholic because these are vegan.  Finally  $5 each is too much for what you get. Unless you're a true vegan and these are the ONLY cinnamon buns you can get  your cinnamon bun dollar goes farther elsewhere.  Bottom line: passably yummy warm buns  but their approach could be refined to make this cinnamon bun lover happier and more likely to return.,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
2u4DSD6F8RyFXp-Crhj8OA,CgqyBmbCUYd5-a4LPMCRSQ,7,5,1/11/2011,I am non-vegan  and I have a hard time believing that these rolls could be so vegan and yet so good. Honestly  they are the best and most creative cinnamon rolls I have ever eaten. When I am trying to eat vegan  I typically find myself at places like Cafe Gratitude. At Cafe Gratitude  things taste good  but extremely vegan if you know what I mean. (AKA it tastes like something a very gourmet gorilla would eat as opposed to what a non-vegan human being would.) If anything could convince me to go 100% vegan  it would be Cinnaholic  for more reasons than the amazing taste.  The woman who runs this place is drop dead gorgeous. In your head  conjure up an image of the hottest Pin-Up style brunette you can think of  (Think Betty Paige meets the prodigal female punk band lead singer)  throw on some sexy tattoos  then add +10 points on the adorable scale and you have probably imagined this lady. She is the ultimate Femme Fatale in that she kills you with deliciousness.    In fact  all the people who work here are pretty much badass. When I went in tonight  they were playing my favorite band in the background. When I remarked upon this fact  I found that the man working behind the counter used to do band merch for that very band! I showed him the tattoo my 18 year old self got in the hopes of impressing the lead singer of said band into marrying me. It didn't work with him  but showing this man the tattoo instead somewhat validated my decision to get it regardless.   And while I find the latest addition of their homoerotic artwork on the walls tit-illating (pun intended)  I am not sure that the parents whose children probably love Cinnaholic appreciate it as much as I do. Just a word of advice to the aforementioned beautiful lady owner  as she is such a good business owner that I am sure she reads these things...,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

She makes a special trip from the City just to get her fill of these cinnamon buns.   LOCATION: Cinnanolic is located right across from the  UC Berkeley campus. It is one of the many eclectic stores on Oxford St:  chic boutique  Starbucks  Afghan buffet restaurant  print shop  etc.   THE STORE: The store is spartan like a small ice cream shop with nothing but white walls and a counter. There is a huge menu board that features the frostings and the toppings. 3 garden tables are outside if you want to devour your rolls before leaving the store.  ROLLS  FROSTINGS AND TOPPINGS: http://www.viewmenu.com/cinnaholic/menu?ref=google The choices and combination were too daunting that I was staring at the board like Bambi caught in front of headlights.  They can customize the rolls according to your heart's desire like Elvis with his PB and Banana  Rocky Road  Pina Colada and Coconut  etc.  After ~ 3 minutes of being in catatonic state  I finally chose: 1.

The roll itself was a little bit denser than the melt in your mouth rolls like hot Pillsbury that's right out of the oven. (How dare I make such scandalous comparison?!!) It did taste like something was missing.  Despite the above observations and being on the pricey side of ~$5 a piece  I enjoyed my cinnamon roll so much that I licked the plate clean. Well  only my cat was my sole witness to such barbaric act.   Although I would have liked the bread to have been softer  the frosting was  bursting with the pumpkin and spices flavors of Fall although it was a blazing hot summer day in the Bay Area. The flavors were just plain lovely. The fact that they were ""healthier"" and vegan  just sweeten the deal for me eventhough I devour animal products.  I did not tell my guy that they were vegan. He devoured his butterscotch cinnamon rolls and told me that he they were good and rich. He liked them. I did reveal that they were vegan after he finished the roll. We both agree that the frostings were the best part while the bread itself was slightly dry. However  Cinnaholic rolls were good nonetheless.   I usually wait until I have made at least a couple of visits before I write a review but since I have changed my lifestyle to eat ""angel (good) carbs"" only  it will be awhile before I would have the pleasure of enjoying a Cinnaholic again.  Not the best cinnamon rolls ever but on a beautiful quiet sunny day like today  over a hot cup of coffee  Cinnaholic is one of life's simple pleasures.

When I first walked in  I was really turned off by the spot because I thought they were pulling the stuff in the display case and selling it.  There were just a few sorry and neglected rolls loitering in there and  I couldn't believe this was such a highly rated shoppe.  I was ready to spin back around onto the street when out the back one of the workers came with boxes of freshly baked stuff and handed them to a couple in front of us.  Good thing I then asked if that was a custom order or something.  Nope.  Apparently  the rolls are made to order (well  topped  anyway) from freshly baked buns in the back.  Aaahhhhh  well now it all makes sense.  My pick of the morning was a nice pina colada concoction since I've never seen that done before on a cinnamon roll.  And now I'd like to ask  why exactly have I never seen this before?  I never imagined you could pile on so much interesting stuff onto a cinnamon roll and get away with it.  Yummmmers.  It totally worked there and it will totally work here when I try to recreate something similar in my kitchen soon.  A totally worthwhile stop in Berkeley.  I'm a fan!,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0

My friend Tamie said this to me as we hovered over the glass case in Cinnaholic showcasing their specialty rolls.  ""Uhh  dude  they're vegan.""  ""Wtf?  Rock on!""  I've gotten hit with a lot of this ""Sucks to be you  sad vegan who can't have any pastries people have brought to the office."" lately.  There has been a steady stream of croissants  scones and muffins coming into my office from friendly vendors and co-workers and i've been rather ok sitting back and watching them consume the goods  patting myself on the back and telling my vegan self that it's ok  this means I don't have to spend an extra hour on the treadmill and they will.  Enter Cinnaholic.   After brunch with my girls at Gather where I enjoyed a lovely  braised mushroom sammich with a side salad and some scallion potato hash  we sauntered past Saturn Cafe and I imagined Berkeley starting their own vegan strip mall much like the one in Portland (Herbivore Clothing  Sweetpea Baking  Food Fight!) but better.    We walked into Cinnaholic and I really liked that the walls weren't screaming ""HEY VEGAN! ALL OF IT IS VEGAN!""  I think you'll get a ton of omnivores more willing to try it if you're not hitting people over the head with your vegan-ness.  Slowly but surely the world is recognizing that vegan baked goods do not taste like dirt.  Cinnaholic is leading the pack.  The dough for the rolls is light and retains its springiness even after reheating in the oven a couple of hours later.  I walked out with the Fudge Brownie & their daily special  the Mocha Almond.  Overwhelmed by the choices my brain froze trying to process what toppings to get with what frosting so I deferred to their specialty rolls.    I love the ipad register.  I loved Bart-ing home knowing I had a box of awesomeness to share with my sweetheart.  I love knowing that I can come back and get something completely different and it would take over 100 visits to try all sorts of combinations.    I don't mind the extra gym time I may need this week for all the sugar I've consumed.    I CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK AND GET MORE OF THIS GOOD STUFF.  sorry for all the yelling.  i'm eating leftover buns as i write this.  i'm sorta shaking with joy right now.""",0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

2u4DSD6F8RyFXp-Crhj8OA,xZsuLm7VHb2JuktFOrvJTw,1,5,8/31/2010,I have a major sweet tooth with major cravings for anything fatty and sweet. It was gelato over the summer but lately  ever since I visited Cinnaholic for the first time  I've been craving JUST THAT.  I ordered a cinnamon roll with macadamia frosting and sliced almonds. It came to be about $4 with a student discount (ohhh one of the few perks of being a student!)....  OMFG OMFG OMFG it was delicious!!!! SO MUCH BETTER THAN CINNABON OR ANY OTHER CINNAMON ROLL I'VE EVER TASTED. It was more almond flavored than macadamia but was still awesome nonetheless. I really thought it would've been overwhelmingly sweet (even for such a big sweet tooth like me) but I thought the level of sweetness was just perfect! The roll was warm and baked to perfection... very fluffy and cinnamon-y. You would've never guessed that it's vegan! And thanks to Cinnaholic  I am now a LOT more willing to try other vegan foods/baked goods. Sorry for how ignorant this sounds but ever since I had these super dry  flavorless vegan cupcakes that a vegan friend of mine made and vegan cupcakes from whole foods  I just thought all vegan food would be as bland... but NOPE not anymore  I will now venture out and try other vegan food!  THANK YOU CINNAHOLIC for the delicious cinnamon roll and for broadening my mind!!!!,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

I picked the chocolate chip cookie dough because it was one of the displayed ones on the display counter. The first bite into was really good. However  overall  I think it was a bit too sweet for me. Maybe it was because of all of the chocolate chip  chocolate syrup  butter sauce  cinnamon and cookie dough. It was all way too sweet for my palate.

They did a great job keeping the line moving  especially for being the first day open.  I really wanted to try a plain roll to get a baseline on their product  but they didn't have any.  I did like the idea of doing the 4-quarter sample pack.  The hands down winner of the ones that I sampled was the mocha almond.  I wouldn't say it tasted like mocha  but it definitely tasted like deliciousness!  I also tried the apple (pretty good)  banana walnut (pretty good)  and chocolate chip cookie dough (this was literally a glob of cookie dough on top of a cinnamon roll).   The rolls were light and flaky and weren't overly sweet.  They got rave reviews from my non-vegan friends who tried them too.

I've never seen a bakery/store/etc. that lets you customize your cinnamon rolls. You get to choose what flavor of frosting (Banana  Maple  Caramel!) and any toppings you want (Fruit  Cookie Dough  Chocolate Chips!). My favorite combos so far are banana frosting w/ coconut and chocolate chips and maple frosting with cookie dough. They also have Specialty rolls if you don't feel like choosing for yourself.  Did I mention the rolls are huge? Well they are.  Oh and I just have one more thing to say - Cinnacakes. Yes  that's right. A giant cake of cinnamon rolls topped the way you want it.

I was so looking forward to the smores one because there's so many pictures of it on yelp! Unfortunately they were out of marshmallows.

It was good  but not $5 good... I could spend that $5 on much more delectable food imo. So... this place is good  but if I had $5  it'd go elsewhere. That and it sucks that they were missing ingredients for specialty rolls that seemed popular (and this was at 10am right when they opened so it's not like they sold out).

I am not vegan and I don't even want to know these buns are vegan because they are just too good.

I was disappointed with the food and  with the current high rating  I feel obligated to voice my opinion.  As others mentioned  for $17  you get a plain (and mediocre) salad and pasta of the day with 4 different sauces.  I  along with 3 others in my group  tried all 4 sauces.  We feel that supermarket jars of sauce from Ragu taste better than these.  The sauces were bland.  Even the arrabiata (angry"") was mild.  The appetizer of the day  which was beans with mozarella cheese and tomatoes  was better but not excellent.  Likewise  the tiramisu and berry tart were pretty good  but not among the best we've tried.  The appetizer and dessert are extra cost  and inflated our bill to about $60 for two.  If you want good Italian food in Claremont  I suggest Tutti Mangia or Aruffo's  both of which have more flavorful sauces.  If you're on a strict bland diet  then La Picoletta might be for you.""",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
2uf4Swj6fRoZ_WOaaVv8bA,leThJg8Bqu0vtOBGVNby-A,4,2,4/24/2010,"I LOVE the concept of a presumably privately owned  super-small  super-quaint  homey  secluded  welcoming  local restaurant. I LOVE the idea that the menu is super small  simple  and apparently changes frequently. I loved the decor  even in the details down to the restrooms with their doors weighted down by heavy pots to make them close behind you on your way in. Soooo much to love about this place. It looks like the perfect place...even feels like it. Welcoming and friendly staff as well.  BUT THE FOOD SUCKED. We brought a nice Bordeaux from home (only a $10 corkage fee)  and both agreed that this was the best part of the meal hands down.  First clue the meal was going to suck: bread basket arrives with exactly two small pieces of bread in it. Hot  yes; but crappy pre-frozen dough. You could just taste it. No butter either.  Second clue: antipasti arrived as fresh mozzarella with tomato and balsamic vinaigrette. The waitress was kind enough to accommodate this  as it was not on the menu as we ordered it. It sucked. The tomatoes were those cold hard flavorless things you get at all the crappy restaurants. Vinaigrette was bland. Mozzarella was dense  and had less flavor than a block of tofu. NO SALT on the table  which it painfully needed. C'mon don't flatter yourselves people...the food is not good enough to merit a lack of salt and pepper shakers.  Third: house salad with olives and tomatoes. More of those crappy tomatoes  with Kalamata olives  but at least the salad was not iceberg. Thank god for at least that. This was just OK.  Main course: I had the Cioppino  which was in the most bland broth ever made...plus a few more of those crappy tomatoes thrown in for color. Again  this needed salt. The waitress offered me cheese  which at finer establishments  this would not have been done. Cheese never traditionally pairs with fish for the record. The pasta was nicely cooked...but it is not made there unfortunately. Bf ordered the filet mignon (not an authentic Italian menu item f.y.i.)  which was topped with a mysterious black sauce and bits of Gorgonzola. They did not overcook it thankfully  but he was not impressed with it.  Dessert materialized itself in the form of a lemon tart...not surprisingly mediocre  and apparently imported from Italy"". How ecologically wasteful. How about you walk across the alley and partner up with Some Crust to make your desserts?  Service was alright. No fancy touches like surreptitious removal or replacement of flatware based on what you are eating  and what is yet to come. They need REAL wine glasses however.  Toal cost: $85 with tax/tip/booze etc. $26 an entr\u00e9e  yet the food was right on par with Denny's  (so I imagine...I never eat there)  I THOUGHT with such an incredibly small menu  and incredibly small restaurant that this place could be a culinary gem.   I give up on this area for anything but Asian and Mexican food now. So sad...  I don't plan to return.  I would love to help them improve their food.  --Anthony""",1,1,1,1,1,0,0,

What I loved about the place was the secret-like location and the very small and cozy atmosphere of the place. Decor' was really cool and the open kitchen was a huge plus.  What sucked about the place were two things: one  the service. While the waitresses were nice and friendly  they were noticeably absent for most of our meal. It literally took nearly 20 darn minutes for the girl to show up at our table to take our drink order after we sat down- we finally had to flag down the hostess and ask her for our drinks.  The second thing that sucked about this place was the surprisingly bland sauces on the pastas- can you add some freaking basil or some SALT  Mr. Chef-Man? PLEASE? And can the salad get some flipping dressing on it? Or some olive oil and a little balsamic? It's funny  given that places such as La Picoletta usually are the ones that are the best places to go  as they are not part of a chain and therefore strive harder to keep your patronage. The novelty of combining"" two or more sauces in a bowl is a really neat idea  but I was just so disappointed with the lack of flavor of both of the sauces that I tried.  I am willing to try this place again  as I am a fair and diplomatic person  but I have to say that I hope Mr. Chef-Man has revved up his sauces and salad dressings- maybe I'll hide a salt shaker in my purse the next time I go...""",1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0

As to the food  I agree with others - bread sticks were overly crispy on the outside and difficult to break apart to eat  though maybe if I dipped them in the oil  it would have been easier.   The pappardelle noodles were sadly undercooked. We wanted lasagne  but were told it was unavailable. Imagine our surprise when the couple who was seated about 20 minutes after us ordered it. All the waitress had to say was that it was cooking. We might have waited. I won't say the term my husband used to describe the sauce on the pappardelle. To me  it wasn't bad (though not good either)  but he reached for his glass immediately after trying a bite of mine.   The salad was good  though I ordered my dry and it wasn't. However  they use dressing lightly while most drown salads  so I appreciated it.   Maybe I'm unfamiliar with the type of asparagus they used  but it was so thin  I couldn't poke it with the fork. It wasn't much thicker than spaghetti noodles.   Be aware that if you order the $9 glass of wine  you'll get about an inch of wine in a glass.   On the upside  we walked to Walter's for dessert and had the small sampler platter. Way to save our evening  Walter's! Hoping La Piccoletta will make some changes.

I have had many celebrations here - Mother's Day  birthdays and anniversaries and I receive emails weekly about their menu. I was hesitant when I received the latest email saying that they changed ownership. My boyfriend wanted to go as it is our go to"" Italian restaurant.   Bread - Par-cooked bread sticks with cheese and garlic too hard to dip into the oil and Balsamic vinegar. It tasted very bland.  Salad - Spring mix with oil and vinegar  maybe some cheese but I couldn't tell because of the marinated cauliflower in there as well. Not good at all.  Spaghetti Pomodoro - Horrible. Very bland and hardly any sauce and was served to me so hot  that it took a good 10 minutes before I could even taste it. I had 3 bites and I was done. Interesting though that I saw another couple in there who ordered the same thing  putting salt onto the spaghetti  I was tempted to do the same...  Lasagna - My boyfriend had that. He said it was decent but not worth $17.95  Service - Good. That is the one star.  Atmosphere - Beautiful as always  however they do not play old world Italian music anymore - I had Madonna blaring above our table.  Wine - Here is my gripe. I ordered the Central Coast Cabernet. The waitress asked if I wanted a bottle - looking around at the other tables that had a bottle  they were a downsized version of a full bottle of wine. I ordered just a glass. When she poured  it was maybe two fingers high. I actually thought that she was out and was coming back to fill it up - nope! I paid $8.00 for a tasting. When I asked her if that was all the wine I was to receive in a glass  she stated ""Well it's the old Italian way"" I've never heard of that before...  The tables had ""butcher paper"" underneath the glass along with a white table cloth. Now I understand that when eating Italian food some it may fall and stain onto the table cloth  however each time I moved  the paper made such a loud noise and I felt I should have received a box of crayons to start coloring - it looked cheap and tacky.   The new owners state on their menu to be assured that all the old favorites were still available - where??? I saw and ate nothing like the La Piccoletta I knew and loved.

The concept of the restaurant seemed fantastic: a rotating menu based on the availability of fresh ingredients and the chef's ideas is a major draw.  Any stars La Picoletta may have earned for the concept were erased by the paltry execution of said concept. My first entree choice was sold out  but I wasn't informed of this fact until 20 minutes after I put in my order. I ended up ordering the pappardelle  and my wife went with risotto. When they finally arrived after a nearly 40 minute wait  both my pasta and her rice were almost offensively undercooked  and several bites of both dishes had considerable crunch. I'm not a professional chef or big-spending gourmand  but I'm still fairly certain that 'crunch' is not an adjective that should be applicable to a dish of pasta or risotto. Furthermore  I only received about a dozen actual noodles in the entire dish.  The bolognese sauce that accompanied my pappardelle was decent-to-good  so I asked our waitress for some extra bread to mop it up. The bread never came  and my bowl was whisked away unceremoniously  with nary a word of acknowledgement from our server.

2uf4Swj6fRoZ_WOaaVv8bA,DYPCfzU2jxMbaGv58K3g6w,2,5,5/28/2009,The fabulous thing about La Piccoletta is that they serve the best pasta sauces  the best pasta and loveliest bread I have ever tasted.  I have never been to Italy  but I have friends who are natives of Italy and I brought them to La Piccoletta just as an experiment - to see what they would say. Their verdict was that both the ambiance and the food makes you feel as though you are at a small lodge/restaurant that makes scrumptious food in the Italian countryside. La Piccoletta is an incredibly delightful place!!   The warning I shall give anyone visiting this charming restaurant is that you may find it quite hard to appreciate food at other Italian/American-Italian restaurants after enjoying La Piccoletta's fare.   Being a small restaurant that is open only in the evenings  they limit their menu to dishes that they decide upon every week. Their menu focuses on quality rather than quantity. The options (recently expanded) include dishes like Filet Mignon  Cioppino  Meatballs  servings of antipasto platter  insalata  and their featured pasta and sauces of the week (together with salad and bread).   They feature a pasta and four or five sauces every week  available all through the week. If you order pasta  you get a plate of pasta and as much and as many sauces as you would like. My favorite sauces are the White Sauce with Peas and the Aromi sauce. Simply Delicious!!   Tuesday nights are half-price on a pasta dinner for two ($11 per person with salad  bread and non-alcoholic drink). The same type of dinner is available for college students on Thursday nights for $9.50. Ever since we discovered this place hidden in the parking lot between Indian Hill and Yale Ave last year  my friends and I dine here at least once in two weeks. Needless to say  Tuesday and Thursday nights are our favorite La Piccoletta nights. I believe they also have family specials on Saturdays.  I think they have a neat selection of wines  and they are all reasonably priced per glass or bottle. Their house wines are good quality as well  and you can enjoy a fresh  fine-tasting red or white wine for as low as $3 or $4. I like that they don't empty stale wine into the glasses of those who order their house wine.   We always order their Tiramisu when we are at La Piccoletta to celebrate an occasion.  I like their other desserts  but their Tiramisu definitely rocks the house!!!    Finally  always make reservations as the seating area is small and intimate and this place is really popular. I want to give a bonus star to their friendly and considerate staff.  :-) I will move from Claremont next year and will probably really miss this place!,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0

We knew going in that the restaurant was going to be small  so that kind of made it a fun"" experience.  The ambiance was disappointing though.  First off there was no music - so that was a real mood-killer.  In general the room was simply uninteresting  which is a real shame because it could be a really special place.  I think what really put me off was when we got to the end of our meal and the server brought the bill we mentioned to her that we didn't get our dinner salads she acted confused and seemed to feel that it was someone else's fault.  She consulted with the owner/chef and came back and simply offered to bring them to us then or pack them up to go.  I think that the owner/chef missed a real opportunity.  Mistakes happen all the time  which is just the way it goes.  It would have been a nice gesture if the server had offered us coffees and a desert to share.  Or even for the owner/chef to come over and introduce himself and make the offer himself.""",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Everything was either too expensive or too fancy or no good.  When a friend took me to La Piccoletta  it seemed like a secret garden - hidden back in a parking lot  only open select hours... you practically needed a password to get in.    I remember the food being consistently good.  Not necessarily exactly what you wanted that moment  but always well-executed.  I liked that they didn't compromise and let you pick and choose - it was Pasta A or Pasta B  Sauce A or Sauce B  and white wine or red wine.  The salad was perfectly dressed.  The tables were simply laid.  It was like going over to someone's house for dinner.    I miss La Piccoletta.  Over on this side of town it always seems to be seared pork belly with sunflower seed reduction  or basil gelato with peppercorn trout.  I liked just having a delicious plate of pasta from people who knew what they were doing.""  That's what I wrote back in September.  I went back a few weeks ago and it was awful and very expensive.  My husband sat there silently fuming at his roll (later described as ""the worst roll I've ever had in my whole life"") while I tried to soldier on bravely.  I don't know whether it was the rose-tinted glasses of my idyllic college days or what  but memory definitely does not serve.  I apologize to anyone who read my earlier review and scheduled a hot date there.  Further updated in December:  I just received a nice message from Lina B  who owned La Piccoletta back in the good old days - there are new owners as of 2005.  At least now I know my memory isn't faulty!""",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0

It's called  paraphrasing. I read some words today in a review (another yelper I admit)  that took me back in time  circa 1977. Here they are in quotations;  There's almost nothing better for me than finding a small (under 10 table) eatery that serves absolutely marvelous food that regular people can afford. It's truly an uncommon restaurant in a sea of commonality.""   Such genius is rare and such was my La Pic.  I found myself magically trans-located  sitting in a converted carriage house  down a back alley in Clement Ca. Linda was busy in her little open view kitchen  stirring her pots and busy as a bee. I was sitting on a bench seat  sipping house red at a family style table shared with strangers. Before long  we would be chatting and becoming friends  if just for the duration of our meal.  I ordered half and half as usual in hopes one would have those little green peas in it. Oh!  how I loved her peas. Oh!  how I loved this place.  I paraphrase once more; ""La Piccoletta  seemed like a secret garden - hidden and only open select hours... you practically needed a password to get in.""   I read through more recent reviews that times have changed  Linda is no longer the proprietor and the menu has changed. Some say not for he better  while still others love it lots. Under new management  as you will.   But this I ponder. Did they know the old La Pic as I did? What have they for comparison? Is there new paint on the walls  perhaps a neon sign to draw in the wealthy? Or is there still that air you needed ecclesiastic benefice to be granted the favor of entrance? Thinking back  although her pastas have been celebrated by the multitudes  I realized I didn't come here just to be fed  but for an awareness  No  it was that feeling I got when Linda would take a quick glance outside at her waiting public and with a wink  invite me in.   I haven't been back since 1990  but I was there today as I wrote this. And I cherish the days when Linda and my La Pic made me feel so noble.""",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

First of all  my wife and I do not like a lot of salt in our food  so we were very pleased when we tasted our pastas; they are obviously cooking with less salt.  If you are used to the high-salt places like Romano's Macaroni Grill the and like  you'll find the sauces tasting a bit bland to your palate.  Their hand-made pasta is al dente.

We tried to go to the Back Abbey  but the Hipster Scouts are back in town  so we had to look elsewhere for dinner. At La Piccoletta we were pleasantly served real food. The salad was real  the sauces were real  the pasta was real  and all of it was delicious. None of it was overtly gimmicky or faddish. The sauces were wonderfully seasoned  but not overly salted. I really liked that. It allowed me to taste the flavors of all the components and how they worked together.  We also had a reasonably priced Merlot that was delicious. The service was very friendly  and they were fine with letting us stay and finish  even though it was an hour past closing.,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1

Over an hour to get fed despite the fact that the place was practically empty. Relatively expensive  mediocre food and poor service is a bad combination. Also  apparently the great bread embargo has occurred. If you like bread or rolls with your pasta you had better bring your own because the waiter is rationing them out to the patrons.

2uf4Swj6fRoZ_WOaaVv8bA,Kw7Hy622-4LARSuj2FO4MA,3,5,3/1/2008,My Dad's birthday was coming up so being the daughter that I am I asked if if he would like me to organize a dinner with family and friends to mark the occasion. My Dad had mentioned going to La Piccoletta years ago (10+) so I offered the restaurant as the venue choice.   As the other reviews state this a tiny but cozy Italian restaurant with seating limited to 35 people. I called ahead to book our space since we had a 17 people in our party and recommend reservations since space can fill up fast at times.  FOOD: We started by ordering an the antipasto platter for for each of our three table. The platter consisted of Tuscan-style white beans seasoned with sage  green onions  prosciutto  other spices  artichokes  fresh tomatoes and fresh mozzarella. It was great over the mixed greens that comes with the meal.   They have weekly menus and the pasta for us was the Penne Rigate with choice of sauce(s). The dinner includes the salad mentioned above  freshly baked sourdough bread (yummy) and a non-alcoholic beverage.  You can have as many sauces on your pasta as you would like. That week they were offering four sauces and I opted for half and half of the Aromi (their most popular consisting of tomatoes  fresh herbs  cream and Romano cheese) and their  traditional red sauce with Italian sausage. They both were unique and tasty. Others in our parties also tried and praised the other sauces that were offered that week which were:  - An Alfredo-style sauce topped with or without peas.   - A Marinara sauce with capers and kalamata olives.  Keeping in the spirit of a party we ordered a few bottles of wine for our tables having both a few bottles of the Bortoluzzi Pinot Grigio (very complimentary to the food) and a red which I can't remember the name of.  SERVICE: George and the rest of the staff did a fabulous job hosting us.   On a side note one of our party members was in a wheelchair and had no issue wheeling himself in the front door.   I can't wait to bring my friends to this little hidden gem and have it become one of my favorite places to eat anywhere!!,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1
2uf4Swj6fRoZ_WOaaVv8bA,eWBU5mr1A8RUISCF3sbU0w,3,5,10/16/2011,This is a simple review.  It's not too often that I get to eat Italian food that's prepared fresh and from scratch start-to-finish  so this place was a treat.    Chef-owner Roger stands just behind the counter and cooks in plain view of the dining room.  The pasta is made fresh daily  from what he tells me  and certainly tasted like it had been turned out very recently.  I had a small plate of spaghetti and meatballs that  to me  was perfect.  There was no pretentious  fancy interpretation here; just fresh  tasty pasta  a light tomato sauce that was wonderfully seasoned  and a few really (really) good meatballs.  I actually recommended to the waitress (co-owner  whip-cracker  sweetheart)  that they put those meatballs on a sandwich for the lunch menu and FedEx one to me once a week.  My friend that invited me out had a salmon plate that was really good as well; simply presented on a truffle-oil aioli with what I can only call risotto hush-puppies on the side  though that name doesn't really do them justice.  The salmon was cooked perfectly and had a nice  sweet crust on the outside as a result.  Desert was really nice  too.  The chocolate mousse was light on the stomach but heavy on flavor.  We tried a couple different wines throughout  and while the selection wasn't huge  the bottles they have are all pretty nice and pair well with the food.  You probably won't be overwhelmed with the size of this place; it only sits 20-30 people  depending on their size  and the menu isn't huge either  but the owners have only had the place for a month so they may add more as time passes  and the chef seems more than happy to create something new for anyone that asks politely  and I personally always like being treated to something unique when asking to be surprised  as you usually get something that the chef enjoys eating himself.  It's also enjoyable to eat someplace cozy and family-run like this joint is.,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0

Found this place on yelp with a group of friends  attempting to avoid The Village  but ending up at The Village regardless. I would comment about the interior  but we sat outside like peasants. No  they LITERALLY made a makeshift  wobbly  un-even  most likely code-violating table for us adjacent to the entrance. Yup.  BREAD. The bread was very average. It wasn't toasted or seasoned and cheese was haphazardly sprinkled on top  not that it made any difference since it would just fall off the bread and into the bottom of the basket when you picked one up.  SALAD: Composed of a bowl of leaves  light dressing  and cheese. Nothing special.  SPAGHETTI POMORODO. This is the entree I ordered. The noodles were cooked well  but the sauce was too bland. All I could taste was noodles and the faint hint of sour tomato sauce. After about 4 bites I was dunzo; these noodles were not satisfying my munchies.  2 STAHS BABY,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Let's see  it's my second day on campus and am totallllly missing my food from UCLA. So far  I've tried their coffee. It's not exactly the cheapest coffee out there but at least it's cheaper than Starbucks. Yesterday for lunch  I also got the turkey and cheese pita sandwich (priced decently) which was pretty good. For dinner I got a Chinese Chicken Sandwhich which was okay....but I would only eat it again if i was in need desperately for fiber.   Today  I started off with the same coffee routine  but for lunch I got their Italian combo which was lasagna with salad and garlic bread stick. WOW. That lasagna was super dry. It was one of those frozen lasagna that you can buy at Costco...but even if I were to make it it would come out better. The food wasn't even kept in a steamer  but a tin foil tray so it was cold and dry. BLEH. The salad was okay  but they piled it on with ranch dressing :( And the bread stick. my GOSH! The roof of my mouth is still trying to recover from the flavorless dry plank of carbs that I was given. All that for ~$7. RIPPPPP OFFFFFFF.  There is still the Chinese selection and the grill that I have yet to try. Chinese doesn't look too promising...for sure worse than Panda Express right across the street. The grill though looks good considering they actually make it for you on the spot.   They also have a fried popcorn chicken and french fries you can grab and go. It looks good  but I have mainly 2 issues with it 1) It costs ~$6.50 and 2) it's WRAPPED IN SARAN WRAP IN A STYROFOAM TRAY SITTING UNDER THE HEAT TRYING TO KEEP IT WARM!!! uh...HELLO?!?! Isn't that just WAITING for cancer to happen with MELTING PLASTIC?!?!?!?! YIKES!  For the sake of being on campus  it's 2 stars. They also keep the place pretty clean.

Rather  Raku's chefs managed to ruin their nigiri by pairing perfectly decent raw fish with random ingredients-- everything from cream to citrus to jalape\u00f1os to some creamy citrus sauce topped with jalapenos.  Then the owners charge an extra chunk of change for these creative"" fusion sauces.  Let me try to say this in another way: the best part of my meal was the miso soup.  Maybe the yataki  ramen  or Americanized sushi rolls taste okay  but we won't be coming back here to find out.  And as for the ambience...

Fast forward to getting our rolls and we still had to wait another ten minutes after getting those for our ramen and they brought it with our bill.

It was PACKED when we came back around 8:30 that night and we didn't want to wait an hour  so we tried again today and I'm so  so glad we did.   They make it all from scratch  so you know it's gonna be good (when we came in for lunch Sunday the owner told us they were still in the process of boiling the broth so it wouldn't be ready for another 4 hours). The owner is super cool. He recognized my friend who always ate at his old Grover Beach location and gave us free green tea ice cream for coming back after being denied twice! Thank you!!

My main complaint is that I've had horrid service each of the three times I've gone here.  On one occasion  I didn't receive my meal until well after all my compadres had finished (including a big bowl of noodles)  so they just brought my course with the bill; on another occasion  I was trying to get my waitresses attention and she looked me in the eyes and hurried away TWO times before finally helping me out.  I understand it get's busy  but you could at least give me a 'please wait a sec' gesture or any indication at all that you acknowledge my request for help.  She wasn't even busy servicing other tables -- I saw her rushing to the back and chatting with her friends about what they wanted to do after work (I was actually close enough to the back to overhear the conversation).  The biggest turn-off about the aforementioned experience is that this happened during the opening week for this place  so it really left me feeling that they don't give a damn about making a good first impression..  This place could learn a thing or two about that from the new spot in the Marigold center   Kumi-ko.  The atmosphere is OK  if you're all about spending your meal in pre-party mode with loud club music.  A lot of my friend's dug the lychee flavored sake...  I gave the place a fair shot  but if I'm eating sushi in the DT area  I really don't see a reason to go here over Goshi  Yanagi  or Sumo...,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

My boyfriend and I will usually order 2 rolls and 2 miso soups and that is plenty. Here the first time we ordered 3 rolls and 2 miso soups and left not quite full. Last night we ordered 4 rolls and seaweed salad  snacked off of other people's dishes and went to grab a snack elsewhere afterward.   I ordered a roll for myself and a seaweed salad to start. I was served last in our group while other people were almost done  had to ask for the salad and received that AFTER my roll.

The menu is very creative and you will find something you like for sure.   I've had the ramen for dinner once and I was so full I didn't even have breakfast the next day.

Being a fan of ramen  we couldn't wait to have a local establishment carry one of our favorite dishes.  So why the low rating?  Here's why:  First Visit: sit down  slow serivce (10 minutes to bring us water) and acknowledge us.  Then when we finally order ramen and skewers they tell us they are all out.  We leave and tell them that they should tell customers when they arrive if they are out of a significant portion of their menu.  Second Visit:  Order ramen and spicy tuna (cooked in tempura).  Ramen was not as good as Raku in Grover and the spicy tuna was way overcooked.  My wife's sushi portions were extremely small.  She never complains and she said something to me right away.  Disappointing.  Vow not to come back.  Third Visit: Two of my kids were craving ramen so I cave in and decide to give Raku one last shot.  15 minutes later  no water  no server  other tables are ordering and they showed up after us.  Very poor service.  Then when we finally get a server and we order our ramen  she tells us they are out.  WTF!  I tell her that they really need to put a sign outside on their specials menu and have the hostess tell customers when items are not available.  We walk out (again) and tell her we will not return.  Even my kids are fed up.  So  if you want poor service  below average japanese food go to Raku in SLO.  I'd be shocked if this place is around in the Spring.,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0

2zHPIfZF3-oiPpfaFLwo_Q,OTndwmlca8tPlb9SEjZMOg,6,4,10/15/2011,"Get: Spicy tonkatsu ramen Ab-10 roll (cheap and yummy)  Pass: Tropical island roll (unless you think the idea of tropical fruit on sushi is awesome  which I do - a once and awhile adventure for your mouth)  So I came back to Raku after I was contacted by Miki to try the restaurant again. This time  my girlfriend and I went for lunch. We didn't tell Miki we were coming  as we wanted to experience the service in an organic way. I had not been to Raku's for lunch and they have a different menu with great specials and more ramen options which is always a plus. It wasn't as crowded as dinner  but it was still busy. And the decor was still awesome!! There were different waitresses than last time  which is a good thing... The waitresses were very friendly and while in the process of ordering  our waitress pointed out a special that would save me money which was awesome. Tony  the owner  eventually came over to our table and told me he was glad I wrote my review because it helps him make his restaurant better - all owners should be like this. He was cordial and super friendly  a great guy. I am glad I could meet and speak with him. He told me reviews like mine give him the courage to make changes to the restaurant - food and personnel. I'm glad he is someone who actually reads what customers have to say.  On to the lunch!   I got the Ab-10 roll and the tropical island roll as a special (miso  salad  and non-alcoholic beverage). My gf got the spicy tonkatsu ramen.  The Ab-10 had very nice presentation. It consisted of shrimp tempura  avocado and cucumber  with a sauce. It was very good - my gf described it as fluffy"" ( i have no idea what that means either). The rice was cooked perfect  the tempura shrimp was crispy and not overcooked and the cucumber and avocado played well together. The sauce complented everything. Very good and cheap!  The tropical island roll had mango and shrimp and avocado and grilled asparagus and I think that's it. It looked very tropical and pretty. It was a good contrast to the Ab-10 since that roll was warm. The tropical roll was fresh and cool - the mango gave it a nice lively tropical flavor  I can't really describe it but it is definitely different - in a good way. Very nice flavors. You immediately taste the mango  which is sweet  and then the avocado and asparagus bring it back down. This isn't for people that think fruit on sushi is gross - you need to embrace the fact that mango is on your sushi. This isn't a roll I could get every time I come here  but definitely different and a good experience.  The ramen was also very good  but we expected that since it was good last time too. My gf said it was very tasty and I agree. She also liked it better than the regular spicy dinner ramen. She thinks this one tasted better because they cooked the ramen broth with the spices. The last time we came  the newer servers forgot to add the spices in the beginning  so they were added on top of the ramen after we asked them to take it back. And  oh man. That pork in the ramen is so good. It just falls apart in your mouth  For all the food it was about 30 bucks  which isn't that bad. Plus  we were both super amazingly full. In a good way  not in the why-did-I-eat-8-slices-of-pizza way  I mentioned we ordered the sushi special  but they forgot our salad and miso! We told a random server  who immediately apologized and brought out two of each instead of the one we ordered. Great service  and definitely a nice way to handle a mistake. The miso was very good - not too salty or too watered down. The salad was good but had an interesting (but super delicious) dressing - it was very tangy. I was also informed that all the dressings are made in house. Well done  very unique.   Special Note: The service today was impeccable! We had multiple servers come up and ask if everything was okay. Our food was delivered with haste and it was fresh. Our cups were never empty. Even the HOSTESS was clearing our empty dishes - I repeat  the HOSTESS. I have never  ever seen a hostess leave her post and help the servers with clearing dishes. I thought that was awesome. I don't know if Tony hired new people  or if these employees were just trained better than the ones that we encountered last time  but this was a completely different experience  and a much  much better one. I highly recommend coming here for lunch.""",1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1

The overall concept isn't terribly inventive; it's another fusion sushi resto with a variety of seafood  tempura  teriyaki  and sake.  We ordered salmon sashimi and a selection of the specialty cut rolls.  Overall the fish was fresh and well-prepared  and the ingredients in the rolls were well-chosen and fresh.  The rolls themselves were made properly  maintained their shape  and were presented nicely on the plates.    Waitstaff service was prompt and we observed no major flaws in how things were run.

Repeated a couple of dishes the second time and they tasted almost exactly the same. So far so good with consistency.   Some highlights:   - Yellowtail Sashimi appetizer. Seems to be their take on an old Nobu dish minus the cilantro. Fish tasted fresh and the small slice of jalapeno gives you just the right amount of heat (I don't like my food too spicy).   - Whitefish in Papaya sauce. A really refreshing appetizer. The papaya sauce is pretty subtle but still gives the dish great flavor.   - Garlic edamame. I haven't seen this in a lot of places and it was really tasty. They saute the pea pods in what tasted like a soy/garlic sauce instead of just boiling and serving with salt. Great idea.   - Crispy Eel Salad. I really liked this. The Eel was tempura fried lightly and didn't feel greasy. The eel sauce with the sun dried tomato dressing tasted really good together.   Medium-lights:   - The service. Our server was actually fine but the other servers seemed to think they were funny which they seriously need to re-assess. Here's some advice for young servers out there  when someone asks you if they can have a new pair of chopsticks don't say no"" and then after a second go ""just kidding  of course!"" Just get them shits. That only rates a 4 in the funny scale (from 1 to 100).   - The space looks really cool but small. You will be seated in very close proximity to other customers so your dining experience might be heavily influenced by how pleasant your neighbors are.  Overall  I've enjoyed both dinners at Raku. Food is legit. Service isn't great but isn't horrible either. Would definitely recommend this place especially if you're in the mood for something more than the standard sushi rolls.""",0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0

I got 8 pretty thin slices of fish  and they weren't even cut well to begin with ( the tuna came in tiny chunks  it had already oxidized and turned grey when I looked at it.)  Most of it wasn't fresh at all and the texture wasn't all that great.  Normally I can deal with smallish portions of fish because there is usually a lot of tasty sushi rice to go with it.

It was a late lunch  the restaurant was less than half full and the service started off okay; my kids and I were seated immediately  given menus and received water quickly.  When I asked a question about something on the menu  the waiter had to go off to get an answer  was distracted by a request from another employee and took about five minutes getting my answer.  We then ordered and the gyoza  which were very good  and two of the three rolls we ordered came very quickly.  I then saw my spider rolls set up on the counter and waited for at least five minutes while both service persons walked by five to six times  not noticing them sitting there.  I couldn't get either person's attention and my kids were half done with their rolls so I finally stood up  walked over to the counter  asked if the order was mine and took it back to my table.  The person managing (or perhaps the owner) then embarrassed the very sweet waiter in front of me and offered my children ice cream to make up for the service.  I appreciate that he tried to make up for it  but felt embarrassed for myself and the waiter.

Their standard rolls are the same price as everywhere else  so I don't know why people say they're more expensive or small. ( I'm guessing it must be the more unusual items they ordered.)  The rainbow roll"" and the ""Raku and Roll"" roll (crunchy seaweed!) are my favorites.  Plus-- a secret insider tip:  I always get their yellowfin tuna cheek (""hamachi kama"") which they always have  but it is never on the menu: I might starve to death without that since I eat there and order that every week.  It's served on a plate with salad greens  and is just lightly grilled  super fresh.  I always sit at the sushi bar because I enjoy chatting with the sushi chefs  and the wait staff are courteous  attentive  and knowledgeable.  The seafood is above reproach.  The decor is modern  colorful  and hip.  They never play that loud booming throbbing music that Yanagi has  and no sports (all that is a PLUS for me). They don't have the wait staff make ear-splitting birthday cheers (thank god). They have ramen. .... and  they have something no other Japanese restaurant in the area has: Yakitori -- the tapas-sized little grilled skewers.  This is the one restaurant I patronize without fail every week.  I am never disappointed.  Go on a slower night (Mon/Tues/Weds) and sit at the sushi bar and you'll get to chat with Tony  the owner-- a super nice guy.  FYI for people who may not be used to eating in sushi restaurants: if one diner orders a roll and another diner orders a cooked item  they WILL come at different times-- it's the nature of the beast unless you tell your server you want everything to arrive at the same time.  Japanese foodies know that and usually order a cold item for everyone at the table to share before other food arrives.

This swanky new decor adoring the weathered brick walls and open ceiling lend to the feeling that the diner will be challenging their palate and exploring novel provisions. The Japanese flare is combined with other flavors  including French. Head chef  Joe Shiihara  has worked for nearly 30 years as a chef in Japan  Australia  New Zealand and Southern California and is making every sauce from scratch and specializing in French cuisine.  The dolphin brigade was once again looking for a fish dispensary to empty. I invited my fellow fish lover to try out this new location from a past love. Sushi Chef Makoto was a joy and while teasing and entertaining us he offered the freshest choosing's and building special treats for us. We started with the Striped Sea Bass and then washed that delectable bite with a large bottle of Sake (5 others followed  but who was counting). Next we had the Yellow Tail and Salmon  both tasted like sovereignty and the sea  akin to salt water flying in your face while sailing.  Next we ordered the Yakitori  but we were told the fire grill would be open next month for us to try the Japanese style skewers. We ask if the sauce offered with the Yakitori had been made and chef Makoto made us a special roll of mushrooms and truffle sushi. The truffle can make women more tender and men more lovable  so we were glad when Gary joined us for dinner. He started with his classic dessert  a Cr\u00e8me Brulee made with green tea that restored him from his meeting and got him on the Raku train. He claimed that this dessert was so good and had such a lasting impression  that it was the only dessert to be eaten at the end of a meal.  We moved on to the Albacore Capriccio with fried onions and one of those spectacular sauces made by Chef Shiihara. We moved on the Grilled Lobster Roll that was bursting with flavor with tender lobster  grilled asparagus  mushrooms  bell peppers and a spicy aioli sauce. I cleansed my palate with Kobo (a small organge pickeled carrot which I adore). Chef had us try samples of Peppered Tuna  Vegetarian Sushi and and Italian Roll with eel  tomato  basil  cream cheese and avocado. Entirely amazing and the dolphins were ready for another bottle of sake and a round of Japanese Scallops. These boasted buttery and fresh  teaming with essence of Titan  so good we ordered another round. Gary tried the Sesame Chicken  which he declared just as good as the Grover Beach location (a high praise).  The next round was Raku's Nigiri combination that highlighted the original sauces with fresh fish and it was phenomenal. Yellow Tail with a jalapeno sauce  Tuna with a pink ginger sauce  Seared Salmon with wasabi and Ikura sauce  Sweet Shrimp with a papaya sauce and Cajun Tuna with a mustard sauce  all were original and outstanding.

I guess I was misinformed by my previous waitress  so the sushi chef let me switch to the sushi version instead. I also got ono sushi  which was decent. the ramen.. I tired the spicy seafood ramen.. let's just say its not japanese. it was very bland and the noodles were kinda.. mm yea. our waiter thought I was being difficult I guess  even though that whole mixed information thing wasn't quite my fault  so anyways he gave us some attitude  which I thought wasn't quite so pleasant. also  the sushi chef said he recognized me from writing on yelp and said some things  which was kinda awkk.....  conclusion: the only thing I like is asian miso soup and scallop sushi. the atmosphere is nice  but I'm not too into the food or price or service.,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0

I invited a co-worker and my wife  baby and mother in law and we went on a cold rainy day. Perfect day for a nice big bowl of Ramen!  The Food:  We ordered a bowl of Miso  Tonkatsu and Spicy Tonkatsu Ramen. I only had the chance to taste my spicy but it was definitely satisfying. The last bowl of real ramen I enjoyed was a batch of home-made Niko Niku Ramen I made on New Years Eve with friends at my house. So I'm very glad that there is a new place in town that serves up decent ramen!  I've eaten some amazing Ramen on our Honeymoon to Japan so this definitely isn't the best I've ever had but being that this is the closest place to get it within a 3 hour radius so I anticipate that I'll be coming here regularly to enjoy every flavor on the menu. I haven't even tried any of the other dishes on the menu and I am a fan.  My wife ordered a beef salad that was just okay  it didn't have very much meat on it. She was sad that she didn't get the Ramen. Next time!  The service:   We came here on a Tuesday for lunch with a baby in a party of 5 and the wait staff was superb! The place was moderately busy as well but we felt like we were more than attended to. We got water immediately for everyone in our party and a high chair for the baby.  The waiters and waitresses were very tentative. Our little one was a bit fussy the day we came on on a cold rainy day but they didn't mind much. Next time we will most likely get take-out from Raku if we can't dine without the baby. On our way out I noticed one of the waitresses bringing out a small dish of ice cream  I think it might have been for our son  staff is very nice  thanks for the great experience and awesome food. We'll be back to try more of the menu next time!  Hooray for Ramen in SLO! I'm a fan!,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1

I was driving around the USC area looking for a Japanese place that wouldn't cost me an arm and a leg for lunch. Soy looked promising!  I went in. It was moderately busy  it was clean  it seemed good. The menu is very limited and a little too expensive than I hoped. I didn't intend to spend as much as I did - $8 for a roll - but I did. What I was surprised to hear was that the roll came with a choice of salad! Huzzah! Shredded cabbage accompanied my crunch roll.  The roll was average. Nothing amazing. The salad? Boring.

Not very good on the taste though.  Their rolls are okay  but the chicken teriyaki bowl I had the one time I came here was tasteless and dry.  The tastelessness annoyed me more than the dryness though.  But it was definitely very healthy.  Barely any sauce.  Personally  I'd rather be a little more unhealthy when I go out but for those who can stomach it  it's very healthy.    A one-time deal for me.  Going back to Manna's Japanese Grill.,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

With each roll you get a side of salad or edamame which was good. But once we all had three bites of our rolls we were over it  they weren't that fresh and to be honest mediocre at best. I got the dragon roll  my co workers the crunchy lobster  sc roll  and a shrimp bowl. And like I said ehh  I dont expect much from a place that caters to a college student demographic. The service is a whole other story. As I was trying to convey all these different orders to the cashier he had a face of pure annoyance  hello mister you are here to take orders and pretend to be happy. Like I was purposely trying to annoy him by choosing the exact restaurant he worked at. Then I made a mistake of asking for salad instead of edamame on one of the orders  when I realized this I apologized and asked if it could be changed  instead of a polite yes or no he just rolled his eyes went to my box and dumped the box out and shook his head in disapproval.

However the other evening I ORDERED and PAID for the spicy lobster roll and salad. Its always tasty. But that night I  placed my order and while waiting the MANAGER WAS CAUGHING WITHOUT NOT ONLY BLOCKING HIS MOUTH BUT DIRECTLY ONTO THE RICE AND SALAD RIGHT INTO THE KITCHEN. TO TOP THIS HE WAS SNIFFING HIS NOSE ABOUT TOW TIMES PER SECOND.  First I saw him to this once. Then I notices sniffing constantly and over a five minute period  sneezing again and again with food all around. I am an epidemiologist and thought nice all his spores are all over my food now. Early signs of a cold one is most infectious. I walked up to talk to him to say I wanted my money back and he went in the back. I left and called to speak with him. I talked with the girl up front and she said she was sorry that she did not notice he did not put his hand up to his mouth or turn his face from the food  but said that was not right. She said your food is ready. I said I want my money back after he sneezed all over it. She said that would be fine but she could not do that  that only the manager could and she could nto find him.  OK SO KEEP MY $10 and even though your cold is over  who knows what other unsanitary practices THIS MANAGER OF THIS PLACE HAS. I have reported this to the LA County Department of Public Health and because I am a USC student I will make sure I keep watch on this place to make people aware of other violations.

They have your typical california rolls  chicken bowls and combinations  but this place could really be so much better.    The steak is hard and not flavorful  the chicken is dry and not tasty at all.  They advertise a $4 chicken bowl and it really should be $1.  It's good enough if you're hungry to eat to help you sustain life  but that's about it.  I only come here because I live up the street and it's one of the few things around that doesn't have a drive-thru.  You will need to really drench this food in sriracha chili sauce for it to taste somewhat respectable.    On the bright side  the rice is actually pretty tasty and the salads are pretty good too.  The combinations come with two types of salads and the portions are above average.

The spicy"" lobster roll I got was obviously flavored with sriracha  and all of the three rolls I got looked like they were the same roll with other stuff on top. I was excited for the side salad  but it was mostly the most pathetic looking bits of lettuce left  and there were no toppings left (wontons  etc). The girl served it to us anyway.

Got the steak bowl  just enough food I think.  Nothing amazing but wasn't bad  definitely better than the other Soy down the block.  Price is pretty good ~$6 for a bowl  8/2/2009: Pretty much like everyone else I wasn't very impressed.  I like the fact they are trying to be healthy but not very tasty.    Parking: Sucks -Just like the rest of the area  it's hard to find a decent space that isn't super tight  though if you wait a bit someone is bound to leave the lot.  Food: ok -Suppose to be healthy  but not very tasty.  The chicken I got was a little dry.  The tempura seems a little better than the chicken.   -Its around the same if not a little more expensive than manna's.    -Atmosphere: Tiny So the place is super tiny and during the lunch rush it was hard to find a table for the three of us.

The plate also came with a bun. The meat was good  tender  but not super flavorful on its own. It definitely tasted best with one of the three sauces(original  sweet  or spicy) my favorite being the sweet. The fries were tasty just what you'd expect  the beans were very flavorful tasting like pork and beans  but my favorite was the bun they gave. It was thick  but tasted like a biscuit. Overall a good meal.   The dessert was good as well  everyone gets free ice cream out of the soft serve machine. You can either use a cone(which is provided) or a yellow drink cup. I actually used the other half of the plastic container which my pecan pie came in. The ice cream is good  but its the usual soft serve. I did enjoy the pie a lot though. Not very many places have pecan pie and this stuff is pretty good. Definitely worth a try to end your meal  I know I will get it again.  It is clean  the staff was super nice and helpful  and the prices aren't to bad  but a bit high depending on what you order. The tables have a rack with paper towels on it which is awesome.

Because it's so close to campus  and the employees are super nice!  Prices: For a small with three toppings you'll pay $3.95. This is what I usually get since they actually give you quite a bit of yogurt.   Choices: The yogurt comes in three flavors: green tea  peach  and mango. The peach is pretty good whereas the mango has almost no flavor. Snowberry has pretty typical toppings plus a few that customers have requested.

Yeah yeah it is cheaper than Pinkberry or Fiore  probably by a buck or two  but hey add another buck or two and treat yourself some real frozen yogurt.    Correct me if I'm wrong  but what's with their selections of toppings?  It seems to me that Snowberry has a less healthy version of toppings than Pinkberry.  Well  it is good that they try to distinct themselves from Pinkberry or other similar stores  but some of their toppings are just whack.  I was the most disappointed by the slushy watered down texture of their green tea flavored frozen yogurt.  There is just no tanginess""  ""fluffiness"" or the ""melt-in-your-mouth"" feeling I get from Pinkberry or Fiore.    Also  it's amazing how they can make a normal fruit topping taste watered down.

If you're up for it  you and some friends can actually sit down and talk. There's comfy couches and a beach-like surrounding that you can immerse yourself in. It's also very clean (though it did just open).  You can try the flavors and they serve both ice cream and yogurt. It reminds me of the Bigg Chill  a bit. They have a number of selections  including both sweet flavors and tart flavors for yogurt and they also carry the classic ice cream flavors. The texture of the yogurt is much better than Yogurtland. It's delicious and creamy. Toppings are also fresh.  I got the child size (which is $3  but $2.55 for UCLA students). Child size is just enough! You can mix and match flavors. I got the Acai Tart and the Malibu Tart. Both delicious. Colleen M. got cookies n' cream and Malibu chocolate froyo. I liked the chocolate!  Probably will stop in a couple of times if I'm walking around Westwood. It's a nice break from Yogurtland  to be honest.

The Fro of Yo: Overall  a standard selection of rotating flavors; from acai tart to yellow cake batter  they'll have it! However I'm not one for the gritty consistency of their yogurts... I appreciate the plethora of options - low carb  non dairy  sugar free - but it's just not for me. The cookies and cream and chocolate decadence were too sweet for me. :( I tossed my kid's size after a few scoops. Perhaps I'll come back to try their ice cream...

(for their .99 cent cone that is)  I always see this place when I walk around westwood and wanted to at least give it a try. They have alluring banners outside their store advertising their .99 cone deal. what they hey. let's do it.  ok so the advertising is a little misleading? I was orig gonna get a dipped cone..but the total would actually be $1.50? but if i got a regular ice cream cone its .99? I ended up getting an ice cream cone w/ pistachio. perrrrty good. nothing beats the price...except maybe diddy riese. but we're not talking cookie sandwiches here  so its all good.   My friend tried their dipped cone and she was raving about how good the chocolate was. She was saying how other places use cheap chocolate and its not good but here she was left wanting more.   so there u have it. try their deal"" either way it's still a deal haha""",0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0

My issue is that I don't completely understand the pricing. My friend got a cone dipped in chocolate and peanuts with a scoop of ice cream for $1.80  and I got a single scoop in a cup for $3....I expressed my surprise and she said it was because cups can hold more ice cream...I guess but then what about the cost of the cone? Usually the cones cost more  or at least I thought so. So weird. Anyways  it was good  though I think if I were to want ice cream next time  I'd still go to rite aid.

3-gxNec5AvaOCLhuukbkDA,idHsnq7rUNAQFL6Ys3SRwA,1,4,7/6/2012,This is tough. Let's go 4.5 stars.  I think Malibu Yogurt has something for everyone.  If you're a fan of the real yogurty-yogurt (meaning  the tarts)  they've got that for you  and in a few varieties.  If you're really more of an I-only-eat-yogurt-because-it's-like-ice-cream-but-healthier  they've got some flavors you'd mistake for delicious soft serve ice cream.  They also have great carbolite flavors  usually three at a time.  Overall  they have maybe 15 different yogurts at once -- which do rotate so you can try new things here and there  but you can usually count on a few tried and true flavors to stick around -- plus maybe 8 kinds of ice cream  which I've never really tried so I can't quite vouch for them.  I usually get the peanut butter yogurt. OutRAGeously tasty!  Under their new management (I think?!) they have a ton of GREAT specials  including $1 cones (which are much more generous than you'd think).  When you get something not on special  though  it does tend to be overpriced  hence the one-half-ish star reduction.  Service is very friendly  too.  Lots of happy-go-lucky smiles and generous samples.  I've also never really waited in line but maybe I go at the wrong (or right) times.  Definitely worth trying if you're in Westwood.  Ask what's on special for a dollar and they'll point you to a bunch of different things for next-to-nothing!  Get a punch card too. :),0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1
3-gxNec5AvaOCLhuukbkDA,8gXeXH8_r_zE4yXgRya6Rw,6,3,4/2/2011,After having dinner in Westwood I was craving something cold and sweet. My go to spot for a sweet treat in Westwood has always been Diddy Riese  but they were closed for remodeling. What?!?!?!?! They never close and have looked the same  and have had the same people working there  since at least 1992. Ughhhh  so I had to find another place to satisfy my sweet carving. I had remembered seeing a new frozen yogurt place around the corner  and I convinced my friends to give it a try. So off to Malibu Yogurt & Ice cream we went.   As we entered we were greeted by a Malibu  surfer type of theme. It is decorated really nice for a FroYo place  and has comfy seating  music playing  and action sports on two large  flat screen TVs. It kind of reminded me of an Islands restaurant  but smaller.   I checked out the menu and saw that they had a lot of choices. I sampled a few of the yogurt flavors  and they were not all that appealing. I decided on a mix of the mango  that I sampled  and felt adventurous and got the banana cream flavor without sampling it. The flavor of the mango was not strong enough for me. It tasted watered down and was a bit too icy in its texture. The banana cream was good  and was exactly like it was named...creamy and banana flavored. Mixing the mango and the banana cream together was not a good combination as one was icy and one was creamy  and I should have chosen my mix more wisely . I also got gummy bears as a topping. They were chunky  and stayed relatively soft in the yogurt. However  they had a slight powdery taste that I didn't like.   The yogurt at Malibu Yogurt & Ice Cream was okay. Nothing spectacular  but it wasn't all that expensive for a medium with one topping at $4. There are several better options for sweets in Westwood  and I would take Yogurtland or an Ice Cream Cookie Sandwich from Diddy Riese over here every time. However  if my friends ever want to eat here again I wouldn't mind.,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

I decided to go to Malibu Yogurt and Ice Cream because I was in the area and they have 99 cent deal going on for their various desserts. I was in a pleasant mood and got in line. There were two customers before me and when it came to my turn  I wasn't even greeted and I myself had to say still deciding."" I figured the person working there named Mike  would attend to other customers and he did.  Since I've never been there before  I had a question on their cone offer and didn't know what kind of cones were included in the deal. I asked Mike if all the cones were included in the 99 cent deal and he said ""yeah""  I then asked  ""which ones?""  and then he said ""lots""   I was waiting for him to tell me which kinds  but he was just standing there.   And then I asked  ""umm what kind?""   He then looked at me like I was some kind of creature from another planet and proceeded to tap the cone cases and said  ""this  this and this and those over there.""   I just stood there in awe of his awful customer service.   I didn't say this  but I was thinking....Over where? On the other side of the store??  UMMMMMM Really???? Couldn't he have named them instead of being rude about it? There weren't that many to name and he didn't have to be a douche about it. Their cones were spread out and shouldn't they have a list of what kinds of cones they have? Even if they did  their signage is overwhelming and besides what is the harm in asking  and how long does it take to tell me what kinds they have?  HOW RUDE! His cocky attitude and demeanor were beyond horrible.  He then went to tend to other customers and I had to go back to the end of the  line and by that time there was a whole group in front of me. I have never had such rude customer service before.   I decided not to get anything and just left. Mike's lack of service left me with a bad taste in my mouth and they will not be getting any business from me.""",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Worth a visit. Tried the chocolate dipped cone and it was only a 99 cents!! Definitely a tasty steal - better than McDonald's. On another occasion  I tried a sugar-free froyo (I think it was a caramel one? could be wrong about that). It was creamy and sweet and yummy just like ice cream  would never have guessed it was sugar-free! Their flavors are rotating  but they always have healthy (sugar-free  carbo-lite  etc.) options. The froyo was a bit pricy  but their portions are big - a kid's size was more than enough.  This place is open pretty much all the time (Mon-Thurs 6:30am-11pm; Fri 6:30am-12am; Sat 7:30am-12am and Sun 7:30am-11pm ).

I like Taco Bell. I really do. I enjoy it immensely  and this one is particularly close to my heart. Not because it's located on my beloved UCLA  but because  one week last year  I basically ate it for a week straight. Why? ASUCLA (who runs Ackerman Student Union  the store and all the restaurants) had printed this ridiculous coupons for students where you got $3 off a combo  bringing it down to a little over a dollar for a complete meal. How much weight did I gain this week? I have no idea. But  I do have an appreciation for Taco Bell.  Since they're almost always doing construction in this section of the union  last time I checked  there was a huge wall blocking the line for Taco Bell. Therefore  expect it to be crowded (it's crowded anyway because it's cheap and college students flock to cheap food) and expect to wait a while in line.   As for the food  I love their Crunchwrap Supremes. Why? I don't know. Maybe because it's a pocket of beef  sour cream  lettuce  tomato and cheese. Maybe because it's got the soft tortilla on the outside and the crunchy tortilla on the inside. Whatever the reason  it's good.  So Taco Bell  be proud!

Due to some labor disputes in regards to something about tomato pickers  UCLA did not renew its contract and subsequently demolished the building.   Go figure that ASUCLA would bring it back a few years later. However  the current Taco Bell is a pale imitation of what it used to be. I guess to delineate the difference between the new Taco Bell and the old one they now call it a Taco Bell EXPRESS. Sure its still a cheap eat but who really cares when you only have 5 things you can order off the menu?

It is  unfortunately  a Taco Bell Express  so this location does not have a full menu. You'll have to venture to Westwood if you want a Mexican Pizza. Also  ASUCLA has it's paws on the location  so expect a small bump in prices. Student wages need to accommodate tuition hikes somehow.

I was excited to finally go out on a Saturday night and unwind at a nice dinner.   Restaurant is on top of the Sheraton hotel in La Jolla.   Service: Waitress was conversing to the both tables to the left and right of me and didn't converse with my boyfriend and I. She only came over 3 times during the whole meal  to take our order  ask us if we were ok  and grab the check.   Food:  I got the salmon wrapped in bacon over risotto. The salmon i have to admit was cooked pretty well and the bacon was a thick cut of bacon. Good amount of fish. Risotto was cooked fine and nothing special about it. It did come with chopped nuts over it  which gave the dish a nice texture with the crunch. It also came with veggies but I got some odd squash looking thing that tasted bitter. Gave it to my boyfriend haha. $22.00  The boy got the halibut. It was panfried and topped over grilled polenta. The halibut wasn't dry and came with a good portion of fish. It came with a cucumber dill dressing. Also came with the normal veggies. $23.00  Coupon: Wanting to come here originally from the entertainment book. It was buy one get one free up to a $18.00 value. However  after searching on yelp they have a buy one get one free up to $20.00. Yelp discount it is!

And if not  you can always go to Diddy Riese afterwards.""",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
3ig_tq9MqJyMiOUI-6kuTA,fhdTiSQ5sCuoGJNnCMNT0A,1,2,8/20/2008,I was disappointed.  Not that I had any expectations - we were wandering around Westwood  needed something to eat  and this was the next place on the block.  I was also confused - the huge mollusk shells that serve as door handles at the entrance made us think that seafood would be a specialty...  (no  I'd never been to an Acapulco's before...)  One room was fully occupied by a large party - so I guess the place is good for groups  but bad for other patrons in that situation.  We were slow to be seated  waited on  served  and even when we wanted to pay -- still slow.  Our waiter tended to communicate in grunts  rather than sentences  and we received no suggestions or assistance with our selection.  It was pretty standard American-Mexican food  with nachos (which I must admit  was a large serving  with a good amount of toppings)  tacos and burritos chosen among our party.  Nothing special  but nothing terrible either.  Looking back at the other yelps  I wish I'd had a half-price margarita to help me get through the ordeal.  We won't be going back  as there are plenty of other places where I can receive better food  and better service.,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0

But even I can figure out the equation for solid 4-star knock-off Mexican and  when one is in Westwood  Acapulco's is it.  +1 star for that one graduation party.  You know the one I mean. +1 star for the picture of Best Friend vs. The Giant Margarita.  Strawberry.  Blended.  It won. +1 star for friendly waitstaff  decent service  decent (fake) Mexican  and  +1 star for being one of the few places in Westwood that does not *always* card.  - 1 star for not having any parking anywhere. -1 star for the fact that every other Acapulco's in the chain is complete and utter CRAP.  = An overall decent place to grab a combo plate & a margarita.

It's decent. The staff is usually really nice and friendly. Maybe too friendly  they can be kind of creepy. They told me that in order to get my friend a birthday dessert I'd have to dance on the table. They were joking  but they were really insistent........  Free chips and salsa is always good.

Also  in the afternoon  not only are the house margaritas $2.50 and the blended margaritas $2.75  but they have happy hour deals on food too between 4-7 (but only in the cantina). Also  during happy hour all tacos are only $1 (though not as good as tacos at don antonios).

After restaurants started closing down around Westwood  I guess this is the only place people can think of for their birthday dinners and events? Ugh.  I have yet to come here when the service was quick and efficient.  It always feels like forever before I get my meal... or even a soda for that matter!   It always seems to be poppin' on Mondays because of Margarita Mondays  but really  it's NOT worth it.  $1 tacos? I'd rather go to Taco Bell. $1 off Margaritas? Yeah  it's still overpriced.  So much about this place just angers me.  More recently  I was here for a private event.  We had our own semi-private section in the back of the restaurant and it was a nice atmosphere because it was full of people that I knew  but the service was still terrible.  I had to flag down two or three people before I could get my drink orders in.  My food - although ordered fairly quickly  took about a half hour to come out... and I'm fairly certain we were the only group there.  There MAY have been one or two tables being waited on in the main dining area  but that should not constitute such a SLOW wait time for my food.  I was really hungry  so I was pretty peeved. So what did I do? Order more drinks.    The event I attended was a semi-fundraiser and it was told that in order to use the private section  we would have to order a  minimum of $600.  With about 50 people  it wasn't exactly easy-peasy  but considering limitations in locations  we didn't have too much of a choice.  It was NOT told that only drinks and fajita orders counted towards that $600 until the start of the event. WTF? REALLY? So what did I do? I DRANK.  But  since we're on the topic of fajitas... I was quite displeased with my fajitas.  I ordered the Fajita Gigante - it had shrimp  steak and chicken along with a side of beans  rice  guacamole and salsa.  NOTHING about it was gigante and for 17.99  I was displeased.  The shrimp was good  but they gave you very little  the steak was dry and the chicken was meh.  It was NOTHING like the photo in the menu. (see the picture I've posted).  To add insult to pain  the plate of beans  rice  etc had virtually NOTHING on it.  I mean really?! If you're going to not put a lot of shit on it  use a SMALLER PLATE so that I at least don't FEEL like I'm being gypped... even if I am. Ugh. So what did I do? DRANK MORE.  Drinks for the night: new"" tequila (took a shot of what was supposed to be blanco... but when you can't tell the difference between that and the anejo... we got a problem)  bahama mama (was eh. all the rum was at the bottom  so be sure to continuously stir)  strawberry margarita (halfway decent. definitely not worth the price and keep stirring because even the blended version has the tequila sinking to the bottom continuously).   Overall  no amount of alcohol made anything about Acapulco any better.  I will continue to come here only on a need be basis and I will continue to attempt to drink my disappointment away.  You're better off getting a lot of that food out of a truck. It's cheaper and tastes ten times better.""",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0

It was the lovely lime green walls and fiesta!' decor. It was confusing. Take that as an indication of how 'authentic' this place is.

Also  I would recommend the giant appetizer platter which you can get for half off during happy hour.

The $1 tacos aren't bad but only on a soft taco. The margaritas are somewhat watered down  although the fruit flavored ones may be worth while trying.

The first thing I would like to discuss is the food  it wasn't the worst mexican food I have ever eaten  but for what I recieved their prices were a bit high. However the reason why i believe that this resturaunt deserves one star is because of the absolutely terrible service I recieved. I would venture to say that I have never experienced worse service at any other place of business. The waitress was difficult to understand she spoke very softly and mumbled. She also created a very awkward eating environment for me and my firends. When I asked her if she could split the bill she huffed and looked at me with a facial expression that said I will but I don't want to  an eye rolling look if you will. Then when she returned with our checks she made a few mistakes with the math and the manager had to come out to help us. He was equally incompetent and did not understand where the mistake was made.

Although the $3 margaritas are almost always watered down and served in small plastic cups  on a few occasions  we were able to sit in the dining room (not the cantina)  and received the same $3 margaritas in ordinary margarita glasses.  They even tasted stronger.  Maybe it was just the glass cup that tricked me.  In any case  the injection of ethanol into your bloodstream on Margarita Mondays will make the mediocre food taste far better than it would otherwise.  The guacamole is too acidic  and the rest of the entrees range from tolerable to good.  In particular  the carnitas quesadilla had me confused when I took a bite of what tasted like pulled pork BBQ inside a flour tortilla.  Skip that one.

After our fist quarter finals most of the people in my program walked on over to the Acapulco's near campus and few of *us* crawled out. Food and drinks were damn good and the quality more than sufficed.   Today  we finished the last final of our second quarter and once again  remained with the Acapulco's tradition. At noon.

Most entrees cost around 16 bucks and though portions are large  this definitely does not justify the cost.   Food: The fajitas  tacos  burritos  and just about anything else on the menu screams deliciousness. However  the desserts really steal the show. For $5 you can get a molten chocolate cake complete with scoop of ice cream. Great for a late night snack or a wrap up for your meal. I also hear the lunch buffet is good. As for the alcohol  it's pretty damn cheap for what you get. The shots are strong and flavorful if you're looking for something in which to dissolve your sorrows (and neurons).  Service: Mario (I think)  or whoever owns this restaurant (or manages it?) is SUPER NICE every time I come in. One time he let me and Vivian L. in right before closing at 11 pm. Just today he was telling me about how his balloons kept popping in the wind and jokingly accused me of helping the process with an umbrella. Hilarity. The service is fast and courteous.   Parking: Good luck finding parking here. Sometimes you can get it on the street  but you might have to fight for it. Better to park in the underground Ralph's lot between Weyburn and Le Conte though it should be done discreetly to avoid a visit from the tow truck.

3ig_tq9MqJyMiOUI-6kuTA,Wnob3OAKqHbRDhOPY6AoqA,7,2,7/29/2010,Sometimes it is really hard to say exactly why I continue to eat at certain places that don't have the greatest food when there are so many new things to try out there. Acapulco is the perfect example of this. The food is mediocre at best  yet I have been here many times. I usually find myself eating here because of someones birthday  so I guess I have had no choice. In my opinion  Acapulco is one of the worst restaurants in Westwood and I would avoid it if at all possible.   Every single time I have been here I have gotten the lunch buffet. It is not because the buffet is that good. It is because I'm scared that if the buffet represents what is on the menu  and I am disgusted by what is served to me  then I can at least peruse what else they have to find something a little less scary. The one item that I somewhat like from the buffet is the sweet corn tamales. Although they are always pretty tasty  they are sometimes poorly prepared and drenched in condensation within the buffet container. When I ate at Acapulco today I was pleasantly surprised to see that they replaced the sweet corn tamales with sweet corn cake. It is essentially the same thing  except the corn cake is one big mass of sweetness that you can scoop on to your plate instead of individual tamales. The corn cake is less watery  which makes it much more appealing. Besides that  the self serve chicken tacos are ok  and everything else is pretty much disgusting.   I know that there are some gluttons for punishment out there that love to torture their stomachs with the atrocity that they call food here. Unfortunately  my friends will continue to choose this place for us to celebrate their birthdays at. So Acapulco  I guess it is so long until we meet again. ~sigh~,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

3iS1I2RfO3bLsnnA17e7PA,Jbu4c3fkBDy8qjM8ecsBpg,6,3,7/10/2006,I like my Asian Fusion  solid  but definitely has a few kinks to work out.  Another 1/2 star bump for it's service and filling in for it's parent restaurant Novo while in retrofit.    The open red dining room is flanked with simple Asian decor  and the dining tables and chairs are reminiscent to cheap Chinese restaurant furnishings with a dark brown finish.    Fresh out of the oven ciabatta started our meal for the evening  but the foil wrapped butter squares destroyed the ebb and flow of the bread and butter process.    The curried potato samosas were presented on a platter and tasted flavorful.    Beef Lettuce Wraps came next  leaves of romaine lettuce  thinly sliced lean strips of beef cooked medium rare  and a fantastic medley of carrots  and pickled veggies topped it all off.  The bummer: we had to pat down the dripping leaves because they had neglected to dry them!  I really expect dry lettuce at ANY restaurant  I was surprised and disappointed.    The silken tofu and soba noodles came in a subtle shitake mushroom broth  with spinach and ginger.  Terrific.  Reminded me of Japan.    Lamb chops rivaled prestigious dining institutions.    They left the Tandoori out of the Tandoori Salmon  the fish was overcooked  dry  lacking in color and flavor.  Looked like a homecooked meal.  The presentation and quality was nil in this dish  even the mint chutney was a horrible pairing and could not save the blandness.    The chicken satay was flavored well with curry spices  accented with peanut sauce  a little oil and charred  but pretty tasty in my opinion.    The signature noodles  Chow Novo  was similar to spaghetti doused in oil and soy and stir fried with a generous amount of chicken breast  broccoli and sprouts.  Scarily similar to something found at Panda Express.    The overall ambiance of the restaurant is simple  casual and the prices are extremely good.  Their are shining stars here  but many still need tweaking.,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0

Stopped in here for a quick"" lunch a couple weeks ago. I had high hopes  being a fan of their sister restaurants & having heard good things from others (despite the poor Yelp ratings).   The food ranged from 'eh'  to quite good. I got the kambocha wontons  a coconut eggplant soup  and the coconut ice cream. The wontons were really good - definitely the standout. The eggplant soup did not impress - there was no real definition of flavor despite the interesting ingredients. Can't really screw up coconut ice cream as far as I'm concerned  so not much to say there. Oh  and also got their strawberry basil drink (non-Shochu  had to head back to work post lunch) which was really great. Loved it. Inventive and the muddled basil was a great touch. I felt the prices were reasonable  got out of there for around $21 as I recall.   Now that the food is out of the way...the service was utterly atrocious. It's actually been awhile since I've had such awful service at a restaurant. Ridiculously slow. I was one of maybe three patrons in the restaurant  and it took me over an hour to get in and out. Now  I love to take my time with a meal  but that's usually reserved for dinner. Considering their location and the way the menu was worded  it indicated to me that the clientele would be largely professionals/businesspeople  implying a relatively quick dining experience.   It was so slow that the waitress actually forgot about me and after about 20 minutes a different one came by to take my order (despite several pointed  but polite looks at the bartender and at the waitress herself who was serving others). Then the first magically appeared to bring my food (!) It then took a good 15 minutes or so to get my check after I asked for it. Also  while I realize I'm young - calling me ""Hon"" while taking my order is a really great way to get on my bad side. It's condescending. I pride myself in having a relatively broad palate and in appreciating good cuisine. And furthermore  I know good food and good service when I see it.   The food was good enough that I would consider giving it one more chance to revise my rating. However  my limited dining dollars are more likely to go to somewhere I know that is consistently excellent in both food and service. I hope they take cues from Robin's and Novo and up the caliber of their waitstaff  or this place is just not going to be successful....""",0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0

If you want traditional Pho  you need to drive up to San Jose  this is SLO town for God's sake.  The whole point of the place is FUSION.  Okay  you don't like fusion cuisine and want traditional preparation  then fine  but review it with that out-look.  We've been 4 times and the food preparation has been excellent.  Good flavors and textures.  Yes  some of the combinations were strange and didn't fell like they worked...but were interesting.  Others were really good and satisfying.  My complaint is that the small plates were just too small. Okay  they were small plates and I don't really like this kind of thing.

We ordered the calamari for appetizer  the kalbi and duck  and the banana pudding for dessert. They were all delicious!    The kalbi was tender and had a slight spicy kick to it.

I was pleased to find plenty of vegan-friendly options in San Luis Obispo while vacationing nearby  so my boyfriend and I headed downtown to check out Bliss Cafe. We parked at a nearby lot that offered free parking for the first hour  and given we'd already reviewed the menu online we thought that would be plenty of time.  There were three ladies ahead of us when we arrived  and it took about 15 minutes to get to the counter and place our order. The server seemed a little frazzled and said he needed a minute to get their smoothies started  we told him not to worry and waited. When he was ready  I ordered a Gopala smoothie for us to share  and veggie tacos with tofu and avocado. My boyfriend ordered the Bliss Burrito.  The server rang us up  forgetting whether I'd asked for the tofu or tempeh. I reminded him it was tofu  and that I'd asked to add avocado. He put in the $1 avocado surcharge  and the total came to just under $27. I paid in cash and tossed a $5 in the tip jar.  I grabbed us some water and we waited. After about 10 minutes he brought the smoothie in a single glass. I got up and grabbed us another glass to divvy it up. After another 40 minutes our food came out  and my tacos were avocado-less. I asked the server if he could grab the avocado I'd ordered  and he went back to the kitchen  stopping on his way to write 1.00 on an order pad. He came back a minute later with the avocado without comment so I figured he'd double checked the order on his iPad and seen that I'd already paid the $1.  I figured wrong.  We finished our meals and headed out. At the end of the block we heard shouting behind us  and turned around to find the server running down the street after us  yelling at us for walking our check. My boyfriend told him that we had paid when we ordered (as one would expect with counter service)  and he said  oh wait  that's right. You paid with cash.""  My food was good  so I'll give it that. But for $32 with tip for lunch for two  an hour's wait  an incorrect order  and a false accusation of theft I expect my food to be great.""",0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0

I ordered the tacos. The portions are HUGE but it didn't matter because I didn't really like my food. Part of it was my fault because I forgot to ask for no beans. I just thought the food was boring.

Along the way  we plotted a few stops  including San Luis Obispo. We had read about Vraja's Kitchen and decided to go in for dinner. We had a bit of a hard time finding the place (had to circle around the block) - but then we realized that Vraja's Kitchen was actually Bliss Cafe. The sign actually says Vraja's Kitchen"" at the top  and in larger letters  ""Bliss Cafe."" We later learned that Vraja sold the restaurant and it is now under new ownership.  The place was pretty quiet  and seating is very casual. It's a small space with several different types of tables and seating. The lighting and decor could use a little work  but all in all it was cute.   We came in and were helped immediately. Everyone was very  very nice. We ordered the Spanikopita appetizer  and the Eggplant Parmesan - both were delicious!   The Spanikopita was packed with spinach. It was different from any other I'd had before - it was cut like a slice of pie  and had only a thin crust of phyllo. We both really liked the olives in it  too. It was served with hummus and chutney - both good  though the chutney was better  and tasted great with the Spanikopita.   The Eggplant Parmesan was really tasty  too. The eggplant was breaded  and served with a thick and flavorful tomato sauce. They had a ""Parmesan"" sprinkle available made from Nutritional Yeast and spices that added a nice touch.   For dessert  we had a raw ball that was rich and delicious. Very chocolatey and covered in coconut - I'm glad we shared one because I probably couldn't have finished it on my own.   My only qualms about Bliss would have to do with the decor and atmosphere. While the employees were very nice  some of them were having a pretty loud conversation out in the middle of the cafe which  because the place is so small  we were forced to listen to. The decor could be improved drastically by a change in lighting and perhaps a more formally designed seating area. But at the end of the day  we had a great meal with a wonderful dessert  and met some nice people who were brave enough to open their own vegan restaurant. Hard to argue with that!""",1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

We were stopped in traffic and that's how we saw Bliss Cafe.  The chalkboard said they had some raw vegan options and smoothies so we decided to park and get something. Being raw vegan  this some sort of fate that couldn't be ignored.  We got a cinnamon roll and a yogi juice.  The juices ingredients mentioned ginger  lemon  celery  apple and carrot.  The juice just tasted like carrot but was good.  The bad part was how long it took - for what we had hoped to be a quick stop  it took about 25 minutes to get our juices!  Should've taken 5 tops.  The guy cleaned tables when no one was waiting and seemed to just be lingering while we watched and wondered how long it would take.

3kgft1U-KAVOH73Tnhm1Gw,SujjhgDTDAvV0ZiNp7sBPg,1,1,3/3/2012,Like many Yelpers  I stumbled across this place while taking a break from a road trip with my husband.  Being a mostly-vegan vegetarian  I was happy to find a place that did not serve meat at all (research indicates that SLO has a lot of restaurants with vegetarian dishes)  and thought the options looked reasonable. I had a hard time making up my mind until  saw that the soup du jour was lentil  which is pretty much my favorite so if it's on a menu  I get it.  We also got a smoothie and a cookie to share.  The lentils were a perfect texture  just cooked enough but not mushy. Apart from that  it may have been the worst soup I have ever had  and I'm including all the yucky canned soup I consumed as a child.  For starters  even though we both ordered the soup  one bowl was full of lentils and vegetables  the other mostly liquid. So if you like the solid stuff  make sure you ask them to scoop from the bottom of the pot. There was some heavy spice action  but I couldn't tell what was contributing to the dirty socks aroma and taste  which made the soup mostly inedible. (Husband didn't mind it.)   The smoothie was okay  your basic average smoothie. The cookie ($4!) was horribly bitter. We each took a bite and ditched it. It tasted as though someone had confused teaspoons with tablespoons when it came to measuring out the baking powder (or whatever they use instead of baking powder).   With all the restaurants in downtown SLO  I felt as though we lost the dining lottery.  Note to the uninitiated: parking is a bear in downtown SLO  at least on a weekend night.,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

To top off a subpar dining experience  after we had finished and walked out the guy behind the counter ran out yelling after us demanding payment. Note that at this place you pay when you order.

However  after this last visit  I am never coming here ever again.  Service:  The service was poor. First of all  I had trouble with the front door that was closed because the latch wasn't working properly. The waitress saw me through the window and told me to press down on the latch  which is what I was doing. She didn't have a pleasant look on her face. Then when I walked in the cramped hallway like restaurant  I felt like I self-invited myself to someone's house. The waitress would greet her friends that came in after me with this warm  cheerful welcome that I never got. Twice this happened.   Then when my order was ready  I got it in a chinese-take-out-sized box. When I asked Is this everything?"" She replied with a rude ""It's alot of food. And it doesn't have cilantro."" (I asked if the curry had cilantro in it before I ordered.) She had some tude going and it left me with a really spoiled feeling when I walked out the door. There was such animosity the entire time I was in the restaurant  I wanted to ask if she was mistaking me for someone else that she didn't like.  Food: I ordered the Bhakti Bowl with the curry of the day for $8.50  which was a super ""hot pepper"" spicy red curry served on rice. It wasn't the traditional Thai red curry. It almost looked like marinara with root vegetables. The rice  which was a nice Biryani-yellow  had absolutely no flavor and was swimming in water. However  it could have also been due to the overpowering spicyness of the curry. It wasn't even an enjoyable spicy. It was just a ""my tongue stings"" spicy. Also  I did not get the fruit chutney that was suppose to come on the side.  5 Boo's for Bliss.""",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

I got the Peace Plate for $11  which came with a kind of sweet raw carrot salad  green vegetable curry  brown rice  and a spicy red Indian dish that I believe was mango chutney. It was all so good! The flavors were incredibly vibrant  everything was good. I had it with an iced Yerba Mate tea  which could be my only complaint  because it was sweetened and not labeled as sweetened. It wasn't overly sweet  and eventually grew to be very refreshing  but I'm just someone who very much prefers unsweetened tea.   The service was good-the owner was very nice and answered all of our questions and enjoyed chatting. Points for very quick service; it literally took about seven minutes for our food to come out steaming hot and freshly cooked.  One of the best things about this place is the fact that things are vegan and vegetarian but don't compromise on flavor or texture.

3r2-QTeRWn0_Er3624El7g,EfJUGYxq9qEfwp1ZDHgGoA,16,5,10/30/2009,While shopping at Guido Marcello last week I ran into chef Ricardo Zarate.  He told me to come check out his new Peruvian restaurant Mo-Chica downtown. Of course I went home and looked them up; after seeing the rave reviews I decided to check out his special tasting menu for my post birthday celebration!   To see pictures from this wildly inventive tasting menu along with my full review you can visit my blog.  Mo-Chica is located in the Mercado La Poloma open air shopping center. Inside you'll find a number of hand made craft booths  a juice bar  and other restaurants. The markets surrounded by fake palm trees  and randomly strewn seats and tables.  Don't let the environment scare you away! I must admit I too had doubts that a restaurant located in such a humble environment would be able to pump out food equal to the 5 star hype.  But the meal that followed the initial doubt was otherworldly!     Ricardo Zarate is IMO the Salvador Dali of the Peruvian food world.  All of my previous expectations regarding how good food can taste have now been redefined.  God built the world in 7 days  and Ricardo certainly perfected a 7 course tasting.  Perhaps by some divine intervention Buddha sat down with the Devil to come up with 7 awe inspiring dishes; and then Ricardo blackmailed them both to get the recipes.    Onto the food  As soon as we sat at our table out came trays filled with delicious roasted kernels.  They were crunchy  oily   and addictive.  The best way I can describe them is to say they're like salty  savory  crunchy  Kellogg Corn Pops!   Course 1: Locro Soup~What a luscious soup! It's made from Japanese pumpkin and had a sweet  buttery  creamy  tangy  and savory flavor. It put the pumpkin soup I had at Grace to shame. As it arrived we all looked at each other like how do we eat it...no spoons? Ya... were stupid like that  we expect spoons  but they set us straight by telling us to pick it up and drink it: it was divine!  Course 2: Causa~This little scallop dish can be best described as transcendental  and savagely sensual. The sweet scallops are coated with a tangy tomato glaze  sitting on top of a bed of savory potatoes. LOVED IT  Course 3: Tiradito~I'd never had a broth made out of Yozu tomatoes before  but now that I have I think it may just be the perfect pairing for fish.  I adore yellowtail belly  it's one of my favorite types of sashimi. It was so fresh  I'd be willing to bet it was cut from a whole fish moments before it was served. The tang of the Yozu reduction was sublime  and balanced the fatty fish exquisitely.   Course 4: Seared Bluefin Tuna~OMG this course was seriously good! It was my second favorite dish of the night.  It's reduction is made by cooking the Chica Morado purple corn drink.  It was orgasmically unique.  ADORED IT  Course 5: Oxtail~This is the dish that Satan came up with  If I was broke and had a kid I'd sell him/her to get money to order it.  It was a large chunk of fatty Oxtail which had been cooked for 8 hours  sitting in barley Huancaino Risotto.  I swear  my eyes did circles in my head as I devoured it; and then sucked on the inner bone marrow. It fell apart  melting beneath my teeth like warm butter.   Course 6: PIcarones~Pumpkin Doughnuts  with a Chancaca Honey dressing.  They were light and delicious  but simple compared to the other dishes.    All of the food was remarkable  dreamy  unique  and inspired; if Mo-Chica existed in Peru I'd imagine people would flock to it in hordes. The staff was wonderfully warm and friendly  and they had a live band jamming all night long. After the meal we met Ricardo and picked his brain for a few minutes  he graciously answered all our many questions. I'm certain he'll do great things  he is clearly one of the most talented young chefs in the country.   If you want a unique Peruvian meal make a reservation for one of Mo-Chica's special tastings  it's a whole level beyond the typical fare found at places like Marios.  Seriously...you'd be a fool not to check it out.  The entire the tasting was $35 before tax  drinks  and tip.  The next event is on Nov 19th.  Keep in mind Ricardo is only in the kitchen at Mo-Chica during lunch  and on Thursday nights.  I will definitely be back again before the 19th to try the regular menu!,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1

I could have eaten a half dozen of these  just so so good.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3r2-QTeRWn0_Er3624El7g?select=IPDbc5LxTsDOtkzDgBY_Yw  Within no time at all  we had stripped all the meat off and were left with the beautiful remains.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3r2-QTeRWn0_Er3624El7g?select=cUhfgo2qPj5lmW2k9wKPCA  I wish I had known about this place when I lived a mile away  but that's how it always goes.,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
3r2-QTeRWn0_Er3624El7g,M9hTMpAcx8Ajk4izAld6ZA,7,4,2/26/2011,"4.5 stars  Long story short: the setting or environment may not be what you expect (like I was)  but this is DAMN good food from one of LA's and arguably one of the countries' best chefs  Long story long:  I've mentioned a couple times that Felicia C was my eating buddy  but ever since she moved to the East Coast for a killer job in October  I lost my eating partner  so when she came back for the holidays  I jumped at the chance to enjoy a meal with her.  She was relatively booked the few days she was here  but we managed to agree to meet for lunch.  I just happened to have a Blackboard Eats 30% off coupon for lunch or dinner  so it wasn't hard to decide where to go.  Because she no longer had a car  and she had a hair appointment in Downtown  I basically had to pick her up.  No biggie  I've picked her up plenty of times  and it was on the way.  After picking her up  we headed down Grand and pulled up the building.  From the outside  you probably wouldn't think that there was a restaurant here.  The place looks more like it could be a community center or something.  Upon walking in  the entire space looks like one of those indoor Mexican markets/farmer's market kind of dealys... like Grand Central Market in Downtown.  And then there's Mo-Chica off on one side.  I dunno  to me  I was expecting like a small self-standing restaurant and not what it really is.  Not to say it was making me doubt because everybody I know really likes it and I've actually had Chef Ricardo Zarate's food prior to this visit at a private party.  After a couple minutes of discussion and deciding  we went up to order.  I got the lamb shank  or what was on the menu as seco de cordero""  with a cilantro beer stew  Peruvian canary beans  and salsa criolla.  Felicia got the oxtail risotto  braised and served with barley and huancaina risotto.  I got a passion fruit juice and she got... I forget what she got to drink.  We both got the ""causa del dia""  which that day was some crab topped with some spiced mashed potatoes and a chimichurri like sauce.  That was good and had a nice little kick to it.  I gotta tell you though  I REALLY liked my lamb shank.  I for one  even if its a little gamey  love lamb.  But this wasn't gamey and had a very wonderful flavor to it and was very tender.  AND it was served on the bone  and well  any kind of meat  leg  shank  or whatever  served on the bone is just going to be THAT much better.  The stew and the beans were good.  I also tried some of Felicia's risotto and I really liked that.  Just full of flavor but not too busy either with the spices or anything.  Everything was well balanced.  Prices are ok.  With my BBE code  our lunch came out to about $30?  I think without it  it was closer to $40.  Maybe a little pricey for lunch  but for the quality of the food  despite the very casual environment  I think is worth it.  Yes you can count on me coming back in the near future and I can't wait for his new restaurant  Picca!!!!""",1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0

Yes  South Central....  The Papa a la Huancaina here is not very good. The flavor of the sauce is too too subtle....almost flavorless....Forgettable....  Oh  the Lomo here at Mo-Chica is almost as good as the best I have ever had! The sauce the Lomo is in here is what makes it so so good. Just the perfect amount of soy sauce and cilantro. However they put too much pepper in it and perhaps a little bit too much garlic. The portion is incredibly SMALL and it costs a whopping $14. There are more potatoes than meat in their Lomo.The presentation is really nice! The dinnerware used is really nice too. The Lomo was served with a small bowl of white rice and a small bowl of cauliflower puree soup.   The drinks are small and expensive. I didn't really like their cebada. My BF's chicha was not as good as I've had it elsewhere.  Service isn't great. No one greets you when you view the choices up above the register. When we greeted the girl at the register her response was kind of awkward. When we left no one said thank you. They just gave us one small napkin each.  Parking was no problem for us and the Las Palomas market that this eatery is in has a nice Mexican curio shop to check out. There are other really cool restaurants here.

3r2-QTeRWn0_Er3624El7g,g0AjhcxvQCqR773jt2GR4w,2,3,10/7/2010,I've been wanting to try this place after reading a couple reviews about the restaurant and because it's on the list (99 things to eat in LA  before you die). It's on grand ave so I automatically thought it was in DTLA  well I was wrong. Mo Chica is located inside the Mercado la Paloma complex (picture a mall food court) which is near USC. We went on a game day and it was hectic!   Ceviche - was different from the average Ceviche you get at a place like El 7 Mares. It had cubed fresh fish (sushi quality)  tangy  refreshing and it  had red onions... I love red onions.  It was a high-end Ceviche.    Lomo Saltado - I had it for the first time and it was De-Lish! The meat was tender  juicy and flavorful  lots of onions and the potatoes which looked like fat French fries were great.  Arroz Con Mariscos - Basically rice with seafood. The bf and I are NOT fans of this dish. The dish tasted fish-ier than what we expected and the Paella tasted like it had vinegar in it.    I don't know if i'd go out of my way to come here  but i'd stop by if I was in the area and if I was craving some bomb diggity ceviche.   Check - another one off the list :),0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0
3r2-QTeRWn0_Er3624El7g,4KeX3mOOGow5AI-LxDvsQw,2,4,4/2/2012,I have been wanting to try Mo-Chica of quite some time now. I finally got the opportunity on Saturday before going out to Belasco. Mo-Chica is not too far from the downtown area so we were easily able to eat before hitting up the club.  Parking: Parking was easy. Mo-Chica is located in a food court type venue. Because most of the other places were closed at the time (Sat ~9pm) parking was relatively easy.  Ambiance: This is a small food court type feel. There are many different restaurants located in the same building. Each has their own seating area. Informal dining style.  Service: The service was good. There was only one person serving  but since there are only a  handful of tables it was perfectly fine. She was attentive and brought everything quickly.   Food: The food was pretty good. For the quality of the dishes prepared I think it is very reasonably priced. We ordered the following:  Oxtail Risotto -- The Oxtail was super tender. It literally fell off the bone. The meat was delicious. I didn't care too much for the risotto  because I was expecting it to be a lot smoother. Instead it seemed a little under cooked.  Ceviche -- The Ceviche was excellent. The fish of the day was sea bass.  It was super fresh and melted in your mouth. I love the toasted corn nuts that were also served in this dish.  Arroz con Pollo -- The Arroz con Pollo was very good. The chicken was juicy and the rice was very flavorful. Loved the cilantro flavor of the rice. Yum!  Tres Leches Cake -- The tres leches cake was good. Very moist because it is soaked in milk. However I thought the cake was a little too dense.  Overall a decent experience. I look forward to coming back and trying other dishes like the Lomo Saltado.,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1
3r2-QTeRWn0_Er3624El7g,AygdRrYTH8o3YfSUqtCUqA,2,5,8/6/2009,This place is open pretty late and the food was good  although a bit on the expensive side. Aji de Gallina (my favorite dish) was a bit intense for me but I still love it. It's creamy and full of walnuts and chicken. I've never seen it bright yellow  but it was still awesome. Lomo Saltado was very good also. And the ceviche of the day we had- halibut  WOW. I've never had such delicious ceviche in my life. It was absolutely perfect.  Portions were larger than they looked and we were stuffed with two dishes. Lots of parking  which is always nice too. The other stands are fun to walk around during the day; you can get an ice cream cone for a dollar across the food court area.. if you still have room for dessert.,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0
3r2-QTeRWn0_Er3624El7g,13KvdiTGYBdvMfMQtWdjYw,23,3,12/16/2010,My friend Ching T. was very kind to share her BlackBoardEats coupon for this Peruvian restaurant with a group of Yelpers that included Bill C  Rick R  Valerie C  Vince V. and me. The restaurant is located to the right of Mercado La Paloma  a community-based  multi-purpose complex that includes several other vendors  restaurants  and a Chase ATM for those who need it. Contrary to its appearance as a self-serve  fast food restaurant  Mo-Chica offers full dining service and carries an abbreviated but enticing menu with a few items that are hard to find elsewhere.  Given the size of our group and a coupon at our disposal  we ordered just about everything on the menu. This has become a trademark of Ching's events  encompassing family-style meals regardless of the cuisine and the size of the plates. The prices listed in the following are what they normally charge on the menu.  We started off with their entire listing of appetizers: Crabcake Causa del Dia ($5)  Papas ala Huancaina ($4)  Ensalada del Dia ($7)  and Sea Bass Ceviche del Dia ($12  large). My recommendation is the Crabcake Causa del Dia as it encompassed a generous portions of crabs  guacamole  and potato salad. The overlapping buttery sweet on sweet ingredients with a slight salted flavor from the crabs was a sensational. My second recommendation is the Papas ala Huacaina  which came with roasted potatoes  hardboiled egg  and huancaina sauce. There weren't enough eggs to go around  but this dish was all about the tasty huancaina sauce. I highly recommend it.  Even though the Ensalada del Dia was fresh and came with large portions of quinoa with mix greens and tomatoes  the creamy dressing was too overwhelming for me. The same can be said about the Sea Bass Ceviche as the flavor was not as sharp and tangy in spite of the slight kick in the end. The mix of roasted and cooked hominy and seaweed added a nice touch to the dish  but the creamy marinade was too heavy to overshadow the otherwise fresh chunky sea bass. These are the two appetizers I wouldn't order again.  Of the main entrees  we shared the Oxtail Risotto ($13)  Aji de Gallina ($10)  Lomo Saltado ($13)  Seco de Cordero ($13)  Arroz con Marisco ($12)  and Sea Bass with Carapulcra ($13). Of them all  I recommend the Oxtail Risotto as the tender fatty oxtail was nicely executed to couple with a bed of barley huancaina risotto at the bottom. The Aji de Gallina has Yelper David V's name written all over as the combination of shredded chicken  walnuts  and Peruvian curry bread sauce was amazing  especially with our bowls of steamed rice. The finesse flavor stemming from the sauce was pointed  but I wished the amount of chicken that came with the dish could be more generous.  I wasn't impressed by the Lomo Saltado as the tender strips of beef filet  salsa criolla  and bulky French fries were added onto the plate separately instead of letting all the flavors to integrate into one another during the cooking process. The lamb shank that came with the Seco de Cordero was 80% dry and can be too gamey for some. The Arroz con Marisco was too soggy as the rice wasn't saut\u00e9ed to an airy dry texture  and the mix of seafood was small in terms of size for it to be remarkable. Part of the problem with a lot of these dishes is that the ingredients were prepared separately  rather than being cooked together. Thus the presentation may be marvelous  there were some obvious gaps in each bite as the overlapping flavors were missing. The same could be said with the final dish  the Sea Bass Carapulcra  which the fish was flaky  dry  and overcooked.  I would give this place a higher rating if not for these mixed results. Adding to these observations  there was no complimentary bread and green sauce which is often expected at Peruvian restaurants. There was a 30 minute gap time between the appetizers and the arrival of the main entrees  with the Arroz con Marisco and Seco de Cordero took an additional half hour to arrive. There were too many gaps in the meal and service was severely lacking as we waited and waited for the dish to arrive.  In the end we wanted to order the homemade Tres Leches Cake ($6) which was already out of stock by then. To their credit  they did provide us with free tasting of their homemade drinks that included Chicha Morada (purple corn)  Maracuya (passion fruit)  and Cebada (barley and herbal). Chicha Morada ($2) was the best out of the three but the flavor was still somewhat diluted.   Overall  I thought their food was 3.5 stars a-okay but not remarkable. I've highlighted some recommended dishes to assist diners to enjoy a fine dining experience and I would definitely suggest people to get their coupon whenever the deal is available online or otherwise. I'd be interested in coming back to get their Crabcake Causa and Aji de Gallina. Minus half stars for the service  3 very solid stars for the overall dining experience.,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0

Canchita thrown on everything  indicates sloppiness to me.  The food was not served hot.  It was lukewarm.  Service was poor and they were not that busy.  Servers avoiding their jobs.

I loved it here for the first year it was open. The food was flavorful  it was innovative  it was inexpensive. I had even gotten catering here for one of my events. I loved it enough to share it with all my friends!  Well  my visit this week has been more than disappointing. The prices has gone up by at least $2-3 on every dish and they have been skimping on the ingredients: it doesn't taste as fresh (sea bass)  the lamb shanks aren't as juicy and tender  the sauces aren't as rich.   It's still decent and I think for people that are visiting for the first time  they may still be impressed. But it is no as good as it was before.

3r2-QTeRWn0_Er3624El7g,06j1gKKd9gYLuZddcdvN3Q,2,4,4/18/2010,This place wasn't what I was expecting. I emailed Ricardo Zarate/chef/owner my reservation and he promptly responded confirming my Friday night rsvp. We tried 4 dishes of which the oxtail risotto and the lamb shank were my favs. Great prices compared to most other restaurants... I was expecting the prices to be at least double or else tiny portions  but it was neither. Delicious  hearty  flavorful food with generous portions and low prices! The lomo saltado was good  but I've had better and the arroz con mariscos (seafood paella) was my least fav of my dishes but still is was okay.  The staff was pleasant  accommodating and checked in on us from time to time. Very good service  excellent service considering the place was completely packed and lots of people standing around waiting for tables.   We were all expecting to pay a LOT more for our dinner  like in the range of $40-60  but it was more like $15-20 with the BlackboardEats discount  so it was an awesome value.  We are definitely coming back  but it will be mid week  to avoid the crowds and we might first visit Chichen Itza before Mo-Chica for some tamale apps before dinner. On this evening  we tried all the C.I. desserts and they were okay  none to die for.  I liked the structure it was in and creative mixed use. It's a mini indoor mall but most of the booths are all closed  so at night the two restaurants pretty much have the place to themselves  so there's great parking and lots of tables as there are several other restaurants but they were closed  so there is no shortage of tables and chairs. I really like this place! It is also very close to USC and I did see several peeps that I presume to be students and at these prices  I would have expected this place to be even more busy.  Free Parking is superb  freeway close but for us non-locals  figure getting there around 7:45pm so that you can avoid the rush hour traffic.  Service 5  Food 4.25  value 5  location 3  parking 5  so I rate Mo-Chica a solid 4+ stars. I just wish it was closer to my home  yeah  I'm spoiled.

3r2-QTeRWn0_Er3624El7g,OU1UWWXAgAiB4yM0NEaPYA,2,4,10/29/2009,This is quite possibly the first upscale restaurant I've ever encountered in what is essentially a shopping mall food court without the mall. It's located downtown near USC and the local DMV but you'll never happen across it unless you are specifically searching for it. It is however quite worth finding as they do a modern version of traditional Peruvian food that's both beautiful to look at and delightful to savor.  It's almost offputting when you enter. There are a number of other food booths around and the menu here is not cheap in comparison yet it was the obvious choice of most of the patrons in the building. Tables are small and seating is almost uncomfortable. There is essentially one hostess/waitress to help you and one server yet somehow it didn't diminish the service or the experience. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful.   This isn't the earthy homey style of Peruvian food they serve at Marios  it falls more in line with the feel of Balcones de Peru but much more contemporary and uniquely flavored. If you want really traditional plates there are other places to try but if you're looking for a slighty modern fusion version of Peruvian food you can't go wrong here.  There were so many possibilities here  we went rather crazy ordering a little of this and that. Starting with appetizers of Scallop and Seabass cerviche and a spicy tuna potato salad  one bite and we knew this was something different.  The cerviche they serve is different. No large plastic cups of giant amounts of seafood here  it's essentially a few perfectly fresh pieces of scallop and seabass delicately placed in a tart vinegar based sauce in a small plate. Quality is king here  and truthfully the few bites presented are more than enough. It's all about savoring the flavors here. The spicy tuna potato salad is interesting  it's pressed into a round mixture and garnished and it's much spicier than anticipated. Not hot exactly  but noticeable. Everything here is plated beaufifully  a really odd juxtuposition to the lack of atmosphere. I love dishes that look to good to eat  and every plate here came out looking like it had been created with love.  With the meal came a soup of the day which on this day happened to be a delicious mushroom soup.  As simple a dish as there is  it was oddly also my favorite of the day. I'm going to be very disappointed if they don't have it on my next visit.  For entrees we stuck with the traditional. Seco de Cordero is the house specialty and the lamb shank is beautifully cooked. Fall of the bone goodness in a broth of beer sauce  canario beans and cilantro it's a typical Peruvian dish and yet not typical at all. The flavors are distinctly their own here.  Lomo Saltado is also very traditional Peruvian food and while this was more down to earth  it's made with tender and perfectly cooked filet mignon on a bed of fried potatos and tomatos. This plate is much more in line with dishes you'd find a Mario's but with just a vague twist in flavoring.  There is no alcohol but they have some interesting fruit drinks to choose from. I  prefer the chica morado at other places but the Maracuya passion fruit juice is a perfect companion to the dishes here.  Prices are excellent considering the artistry and quality of every plate. At $10-$15 per entree they're right in line with other Peruvian outposts  maybe it's the setting here but it throws you off when you look around.  In a city with plenty of wonderful Peruvian restaurants to choose from  this is a welcome addition to the scene and a place with it's own character and identity. Mario's is probably still my favorite but it's really not the same type of food. The food and presentation here wouldn't be out of the place in a five star restaurant. In fact I'd recommend eating here while it's still just a food court stop  because it's only a matter of time until they move to a real restaurant and start charging accordingly.

You can get validated parking as long as you eat in the food court for 1.5 hours (i think). Enter from the street that is east of Hope.  First time i was here  i was ready to give it 5 stars. Had the oxtail braise on the risotto and it was super good. A little unsure why they gave me a side of rice to accompany my risotto though  but would probably prefer that over the salad anyway. The soup was a nice addition (i think it was brocoli soup). Was definitely going to come back even though its pricey for lunch (13$).  The second time i was here i decided that i felt like giving it 3 stars. I had the lamb shank and maybe i was expecting too much. It didn't even come close to how well the oxtail was prepared. I felt like my lamb was overly salty for some reason. My fiance also got the barely tea  and it didn't taste so hot. My dish was also 13$ this time around... i think i'll stick to the oxtail next time.  Odd observation: The two ladies that manage the front (the owners maybe?) are authentically Japanese... which makes me scratch my head.

I'd be interested in seeing how the other restaurants compare.   I've been bemoaning the lack of Peruvian fine dining in L.A. like what you can find in South America and although this place is very good  it doesn't compare to the places in South America. But that's not at all fair  since I wouldn't describe this as fine-dining  more of a home-cooked meal type menu with some heavy dishes.  There is no way I'm coming to a touted Peruvian joint without trying the ceviche and the ceviche of the day was indeed good.  Quality fish for sure.  I ended up ordering the lamb which was super tender and the sauce super flavorful  The recommended oxtail was popular in our group and was well received.  Our server was attentive and friendly.

But we had some AMAZING food while we were there! I had heard of Mo-Chica so much and I knew from just hearing from everyone who had gone that Chef Ricardo Zarate does not disappoint. And yes  everything I heard was completely true!  Mo-Chica is located in Mercado La Paloma. It's like a food court  so definitely NOT what I expected because...it's Mo-Chica! But still I didn't care.

And our food was presented in a bento-like form with a salad and potato salad side.  I recommend going early cause this place gets pretty packed.  I went early enough to beat the dinner rush at around 6ish.    My only con or confusion for that matter was actually finding the place.  Mo-Chica's is located near USC in a warehouse-like swap meet styled mini-mall.  I totally was not expecting to find it in the food court of this South American mini-mall.  So this place really is more of a hidden gem in LA.,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1
3r2-QTeRWn0_Er3624El7g,25uf9bypTSgTGkNSqpfMOQ,6,4,12/12/2010,Lomo Saltado  with a fragrance more beautiful than any woman I have ever encountered this dish will catch your eyes  scent and pure imagination.  I had the joy of dining with Ching who set this up  Daniel  Val  Rick and Bill.  The restaurant was in a food court area which was itself inside a small and lovely mini-mall with latin food  decor & a live mass.  They had a few drinks we sampled but most of us went with the coke.  They did not have a fountain it came in a can.  The tables and chairs were comfy and not too upscale.  We started off with four apetizers.  The servings were not huge but filling after sampling many bites throughout the evening.  we had the Ceviche del Dia which consisted of market fish  seaweed  Peruvian corn  Leche de tigre(marinade).  The Peruvian potato salad of the day was small and went quickly.  Everyone loved the Roasted potatoes with Huancaina sauce.  Those potatoes were warm  soft  a flavor not overpowering and a hint of heat  just perfect.  The crab cake came if and it seemed everyone enjoyed it  I am not a crab fan myself.  The entrees were as beautiful to look at as they were to eat.  I tried the Aji de Gallina which was a soothing and pleasantly flavored broth and breading with shredded chicken.  The Oxtail with Risotto may have had the best presentation.  I enoyed the nuttyness and smooth flavor of the Risotto.  I also enjoyed the Seco de Cordero  this lamb has a flavor similar to many deer plates I have enjoyed.  I opted out on the Arroz con Mariscos(rice with seafood) but dove into the Lomo Saltado.  The Lomo Saltado with thick steak fries on top of lean  moist  soft beef next to red onions and tomatoes tasted as great as it smelled.  This dish is an influence from the Chinese as many dishes of my ancestral home  Mexicali Mexico  no wonder I liked it so much.  The whole experience was cool and the staff there was freindly the whole evening.  There was plenty of parking and tables to eat at.  If you come by there are latin american clothing and dolls for purchase.  They closed down around 9pm  thier hours are on the website.  I recommend this eatery but be careful if you bring a date as you may end up falling in love with one of the dishes.,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1

The only natural cure for this craving?  Fresh fish Peruvian style ceviche at Mo-Chica...of course.  And while you're there....go a little caveman and rip some flesh off a ginormous lamb shank....  The super friendly hostess had a killer pompadour like"" backcombed quiff that would make Elvis Presley and Conan O' Brien jealous....I was in awe.  Politely asked for my ceviche of the day ($5) (which happened to be fresh Sea Bass) and the Seco de Cordero ($13) (Lamb Shank) with a  Chicha Morada ($2) (purple iced tea).  Took my number and snagged a seat in the food court awaiting my culinary treats.  The Chicha Morada and ceviche arrives first http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-WZH-_d_ta-krbeuyTraqA/l and I am rather taken aback....hominy?! seaweed?! sweet potato!?

THE MOST UNIQUE Ceviche interpretation I have EVER had.  LOVED it.  I could have walked out right then and there and been pretty satisfied...but wait....the best is yet to come.  My lamb shank arrives on a wooden board accompanied by a bowl of white rice  marinated cucumber slices and warm garlic bread. http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FamZCQTkk6hmtiu2x3VChA/l I frantically look for a knife to slice off some lamb shankness...but it's nowhere to be found....i give it a gentle nudge with my fork....and it literally falls off the bone!  http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/N7IfLgwnWZi8saB5pG1W5A/l This flesh is tender  succulent and OH SO flavorful...accompanied by red onion slices  small diced tomato  carrot and peas...swimming in a cilantro beer stew gravy with big ol' Peruvian canary beans....gawdamn.  I am so enamored with this shank of meat I fumble my garlic bread and it falls to the floor after taking a bite!  I scramble to keep the 5 second rule in effect and ""sheepishly"" (no pun intended) place the bread back on my table... I enjoy the remainder of the lamb quite avidly and am left with a moderate sized pool of lonely lamb stew gravy.  So I throw caution to the wind and sop up that gravy with my tainted garlic bread...and fulfill my gluttonous day of destiny with a big ""sheepish"" grin on my face.

My mouth is salivating as I type.  Then we tried the Causa Del Dia  a Peruvian potato salad treat bursting with Incan spices and was so good.

Chicken kabobs  shawerma  falafel  tabouli  hummus and pita chips are all tasty and recommendable.  It's best to order multiple items and share.  Rarely  some of the dishes are served too salty or tangy  as consistency is one of Pita Pita's weaknesses.  It seems like a different restaurant every time.  That dish you ordered last time with rice and salad is now served with hummus instead.  Next time  expect it will be a different arrangement.  There's a bit of a language barrier while ordering but misunderstandings are easily resolved.  There's a peculiar hallway between Pita Pita and Japon Bistro  and apparently both share the same restroom facilities as well as neglecting the responsibility of cleaning them.  Parking is limited and it's often easier to park behind the Regency and walk over.

Our dishes came with sides of beans that seemed totally out of place.  We tried several items on their menu that included the following:  lamb stew: gamey and not for the unadventurous.  I am a fan of lamb  but this dish I could do without.   vegetable platter: meh to say the least.    spicy chicken: spicy??? not at all! tasted like chicken in tomato sauce.    hummus: not enough flavor.  pita chips: either fried too long or in old oil.

Now they're replaced it with this greek establishment.  Based on my visits to Zankou Chicken & Mediterranean Cafe  I have a slight feel of how greek food is.  I usually order the Chicken Shawerma so I know how to compare between these places.  Yep  you guessed it  I ordered the chicken shawerma plate here and got exactly that.  The price was $8.95 and the plate was huge.  However  you surely do not pay for the flavor since the chicken is not quite as soft as Mediterranean Cafe  nor is it as good as M.C.  The hommus is also not up to par with M.C.  In fact  it has a strange taste to it.  They're stingy on the pita bread though  as they only give you 1/2 of a whole round pita bread  which is small to begin with.  My co-workers ordered the lula dish.  The description was 1 skewer (ONE skewer only?!?!?) with rice and salad.  The beef that came with the dish was not skewered.  In fact  it looked like one long piece of feces that came out of a cow's ass and that cow had been sitting on the toilet reading and FINISHING a book.  Truly unappetizing.  What's even stranger to me is that they serve beans with all the dishes.  They're like mexican beans  but not refried though.  They taste ok  but I thought this was a strange side-dish.  I most likely will not go back.  I prefer to go to Mediterranean Cafe for much much better food.,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0

Ambiance is bland  and street parking sucks. However  the food is pretty tasty.  I was having a serious craving for some lamb last night and Pita! Pita! came to mind as the nearest Greek-ish place. I guess I was confused regarding a pita versus a gyro. I thought they were pretty much the same thing  but apparently not. Also  Pita! Pita! is not Greek.  I drove over  walked in  and checked out the menu. I asked the girl behind the counter  So  do you sell gyros?"" She gave me a blank look. There was a picture of some sort of wrap that looked close enough to what I had in mind  so I asked for the lamb roast  plain  with tzatziki. ""Tahini?"" she replied. ""Um  sure!"" I said. This should have been my first clue that I didn't know what the hell I was doing. I like tahini  so I figured she was just trying to up-sell me with a side.  A couple of minutes later  she handed me a bag and I walked out. I opened the bag in my car and found a styrofoam container of lamb  along with some tahini sauce and pita chips  but no wrap. I walked back in.  ""I don't think this is what I ordered "" I said. There was a guy behind the counter and I explained to him that I was trying to get a gyro.

Pita Pita  I know I was in the wrong. Will you still let me have your yogurt chicken?  Food: The meal starts off with Pita Pita's signature pita chips. These things are deep fried to perfection and you can even buy a bag for the road. My entree consisted of chicken cooked in two ways  a salad  and two sides. First up was the 1/4th roasted chicken (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/01xOhO708S2F_ONq4wLFXg?select=BwAMRXikRNPBMH8_naWBaA). Now  you can get this in almost whatever fraction of a chicken you might fancy  but even 1/4 was too much for me. While I liked the skin  I found the meat to be a bit too dry. More appetizing was the yogurt chicken which came with rice  beans  and a salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/01xOhO708S2F_ONq4wLFXg?select=uSebwckAYr8MR4_kTcRAtg). When the plate came  I was a bit grossed out. The chicken bobbed in a veritable sea of white liquid yogurt. It looked like ____. My attitude totally changed after trying it  though. The tender chicken chunks blended with the yogurt flavor to create a most pleasing taste. As for the sides  they did not live up the the high standard Med Cafe has set. The rice was bland and a little hard. The beans... they were your standard beans. I'd say the salad was pretty decent  but nothing to write to mom about.   Atmosphere: It's a bit cramped in here and not suitable for super large parties. I didn't know why  but I felt like I was eating at a Subway. Perhaps they got their tables from the same place. Not sure I'd rate this as the cleanest place around.   Service: Meh.   Synopsis: Good pita chips. Great yogurt chicken. Not much impressed with the other items.,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

Pita Pita restaurant serves authentic Middle Eastern food that's delicious  fresh and affordable. They're located on Colorado Blvd. (between Lake Ave. & Mentor St.) in Pasadena. Parking validation is available on Mentor Street. For a small place  seating is very spacious  clean and casual.   My favorites dishes are the rotisserie half chicken and lamb kabobs plates which were both tender and succulent. I ordered the chicken with 2 sides (grilled vegetables and Greek salad) for $9. The smokiness from the grilled vegetables (bell peppers  egg plant and zucchini) were delicious and flavorful. Lamb kabobs plates comes with a salad  rice  beans and pita bread ($9.50). Good portions and fantastic. Both dishes served with complimentary pita bread and pita chips. Also  try their salsa and garlic sauce which are perfect condiment on chicken and meats.

The Owner Himself took my order behind the old-school counter....the entire vibe somewhat schizo: homey as you first enter and kind of greasy-spoon-esque when you venture further inland.   The establishment has been around for some time now  and it shows. The owner is hospitable enough  but most of decor is self-aggrandizing. I get it  I'm already in your spot. I tried the pita chips and chicken curry. Nothing too special  I could taste a lot of sodium.   Make sure you sit right by the window  underneath the TV.

Now parking isn't that much of an issue; there's plenty of street parking and sometimes I'll park far away or in the Rite Aid parking and walk a couple of blocks.  This place has a good selection of Mediterranean  Greek  Middle Eastern  and Armenian meals. Along with the usual staples like falafels  gyro wraps and greek salads  Pita Pita also has a breakfast menu.  Now  this place opens up very early in the morning. 7am to be exact  8 am on Sunday. So if you need something different other than coffee and a bagel  try Armenian sausage and a coffee. You might like.  Now for the menu  some of the pita wraps don't have much of a taste. It tastes a little bland and they don't seem to stuff it full of meat  lamb  etc. To me  it seems like the pita is 50% pita  30% veggies and 20% meat. But they make it up with the chicken plate. You can get 1/4 to full chicken dinners...and you can choose dark to all white meat.   Good stuff  filling food  it will hit the spot  the staff there is very nice to me whenever I walk in.

Just a heads up  the street crossing machines talk. They tell you when to cross and which street you are crossing. It's pure magic but it scared the beejeezus out of me each time.   After checking out a few shops and being wowed by the light posts I thought I ought to feed my grumbling tummy. I also wanted to make sure my meal was somewhat healthy. This is how I ended up inside Pita! Pita!. For whatever reason the insides are decorated with a mix of Middle Eastern influence and a lot of Mexican. It's odd. But the food looked good so I ignored it.   It's order at the counter. The man behind said counter pointed me to the menu and smiled. I looked at it for a little bit and settled on 1/4 dark meat chicken. They were out. This makes me sad. Then I decided to order a side of dolmas (4pc). I didn't have any cash and the minimum for a card is $5 so I also had a side of hummus.  I went to the bathroom and when I came back all my food was ready to go. The nice counter man even brought me some utensils. The dolmas were okay. There was this sauce that came with them that had some serious stealth kick. It was tasty. The real star was the hummus. It was super smooth and extremely delicious. It's served with a few pita chips and a few slices of pita. I ate all 4 pita chips and 1/2 a pita. I considered licking the hummus out of the bowl but figured that might be inappropriate (though I was the only person there).   For a quick bite of Middle Eastern food in a Mexican environment I would recommend Pita! Pita!  You may not be wowed but you will leave with a smile & (if you are anything like me) some hummus on your face.,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

The chicken didn't taste fresh - like it was cooked a few days ago and they were just waiting to finish the batch before adding new ones under that steel container. The plate had a side salad that was almost inedible because there was so much oregano with the dressing - a little less oregano and more olive oil and vinegar please. The rice and beans tasted a little bit like Mexican food. I did like the hummus but can you really mess up hummus that much? And what is up with the deep fried pita bread - it was so so  but for that much fat and calories it should be amazing!

I walked into the place  and was quickly greeted by a kind fella who showed me to the counter to make my order. I scanned the menu for a moment and found myself interested in a plate of Soujok (Armenian Sausage.)   So I ordered  payed the lady  and because the weather was nice and cozy  I sat outside.  I waited for just about three minutes  and soon after  the server delivered a scrumptious looking dish with eggs and onions  diced potatoes  bits of cheese  two slices of pita bread  and a chunky side of sour cream on the side to top it all off. Before I started eating  I took a moment to look at the plate  and I appreciated the size of it  as in that instant the dish appeared to me like the right meal for the right price.  But then  the potatoes weren't that great. There was nothing horrible about them  but there also wasn't anything remarkable. They were finely cut and all  but the taste was just weak.   I got over it quick though  as I grabbed my pita bread and stuffed it full of eggs and sausage bits. I put whipped cream in there  and it looked like a delicious little monster waiting to be devoured as I held the bread in my hands.  But then  the sausage was really bad.  It didn't feel tender at all  and I don't know how it happened  but from my experience in the kitchen  its really not that hard to make sausages chewy and delightful. Something went wrong here  and even though I finished everything on the plate  I couldn't help but resent the bad Soujok  as it interfered with the tasty eggs and whipped cream!  At another joint  a meal like that added to some bad service  and I'd probably put on my Cynic hat and skip the place the next time around. But I want to give Pita Pita a chance  in part because of all the good reviews on here  but more so because of the polite service from the kind fella.  He came outside to check if everything was alright in the middle of my meal  and after I told him that it was  he wished me a good lunch.   These days  more than ever  service rocks!,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1

I will admit to walking by this place for over a year before I actually decided to go in and try it.   What is not to like about falafel  hummous  etc.. and this place does a very tasty job of putting it all together.   I love their homemade pita chips and make sure to ask for a small cup of their ginger hot sauce (which can be purchased to take home) it is amazing!

Seriously wasn't expecting to find a hidden gem like this here in Pasadena. (This place is down right around the block from Pasadena's Ice House. This place is also next to Love Birds Cafe and a Japanese Restaurant named Japon) The food is Lebanese  with perhaps a mix of Hispanic culture? Well we had a side of pinto beans... so maybe? Well whatever it is  it was delicious. I ordered the veggie combo and my boyfriend ordered the Lula Kabob plate. His meat was a bit skimpy  but the other items were very generous. You are given an unlimited amount of deep fried pita chips and half split pita bread with your meal.   The meal also comes with a delicious spicy eggplant dip. I believe it's called eggplant cavier. (I know it's really popular in the Armenian culture... I have a good friend who introduced me to the whole Armenian food culture and it's incredible!). You can actually purchase eggplant cavier at the Armenian stores if you love this stuff so much.   This place also sells some delicious looking pasties  but unfortunately we were too full to purchase any and didn't feel like ordering any to take home.   Pedro  I believe the owner or manager of the restaurant  is very friendly. He greeted everyone who came into the restaurant. He handed us a menu and made some suggestions for us. Him and his staff were more than accommodating.   Parking out front is the 1 hour street parking.

In my opinion  the only thing you can really judge what makes a good INO or not is the employees and how well they do their job.   With that being said  let it be known that the Upland INO is consistently messing up my orders and have done so for years. At first I thought it was a coincidence  but after 8 years of poor service and wrong orders I have to say it's not. Bottom line is that the employees at this store cannot get it together.   Please understand  I love INO and will always love INO. I enjoy INO at least twice a week  sometimes more. The Upland store is the closest one to my home  but I do everything in my power to avoid going to it. The only time I will attempt to go there is when I am coming from home and returning to my home with the food. Otherwise I will go to another store where I know I'll be receiving the excellent service that INO is known for.   I have complained numerous times about this store to their corporate headquarters. I've received more vouchers for messed up orders than I can truly remember. It really is unbelievable how often these guys get it wrong. I suppose every family has to have the awkward stepchild  and the Upland store is just that for INO. The only thing they are consistent with is their ability to get your order wrong. They did it the other night for me; they did it the last time I was there a year and a half ago; they did the six months prior to that.   I seriously don't know if it's the management  the quality of the pool of people to choose from as employees  or some kind of curse that might be over this particular store. Maybe it's just out of it's element because it's a family run corporation with family values and the sad reality that this store is surrounded by adult stores and strip clubs...who knows?

I normally wouldn't mind but my lunch break ends at 1pm so that is no bueno.  I ordered my burger medium rare with garlic/parsley fries and my boss got his medium. Burgers came out well done  really dry  and carmelized onions that seemed to have come right out of the refrigerator(Not sure but just noticing by how cold they were).  Fries tasted like normal fries with only a few of them tasting like they had any garlic at all.  Since we were in a hurry  and the burgers arriving after our lunch hour was actually over  we did not complain/comment about the food. All I know is that Skylight Gardens disappointed in delivering the delicious burger we were looking for so I do not think I will be heading back any time soon,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

Let's start with decor...  This place is in an old beautiful brick building nestled in the heart of Westwood.  The seating is nicely spaced  there are great views from practically every seat in the house.  There is a beautiful bar along with a couple of dining rooms if I remember correctly.  As I've only been here once I can't describe the decor in detail  but I do remember being quite impressed.  Service... It was pretty busy on the night I went  I think one of the dining rooms wasn't open as this restaurant is brand new.  BUT...we were sat immediately  greeted by our server and served water as we were sitting down.  The menu was explained to us and we were checked on normally  but not frequently enough where it became annoying and overbearing.  Food... Amazing...  My girlfriend and I started with a beef carpaccio dish that was perfectly seasoned and a perfect portion to get our taste buds tingling.  For our main course we both had pastas  I had a Lobster Ravioli that was amazing  stuffed with tons of lobster  hand wrapped  and just flat out amazing.  My girlfriend has a truffle pasta that was so rich and amazing that I ended up eating half of her dish as well  and on a side note they offer gluten free options which is AMAZING b/c my girlfriend has an allergy to wheat and we often find our dining choices limited  and I noticed no difference in taste between my full-of-gluten pasta and her gluten free pasta.  We also ended the night with a nice scoop of vanilla ice cream which was not on the dessert menu but they were nice enough to accomodate my girlfriends gluten allergy.  Overall... My dining experience was great... 10/10 or in this case -- 5 stars.  I will return to the skylight gardens next time i'm on the east side of the 405 looking for some great italian grub.,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0
08k0jjos42MrcMxtiOlPxA,wwRsMMd_qFwlb46Yhtzo_Q,3,5,2/21/2012,If you haven't been to this incredible italian restaurant in the heart of Westwood yet  you are missing out! The decor is nothing short of lovely and romantic with its rustic brick walls  soft lighting and elegant circular feel. The friendly  knowledgeable staff is superb and the food is outstanding. Although the grand opening is not until March 1st  I had the pleasure of dining there with a friend last week and boy  was I impressed.  Although they have several choices of homemade pasta and pizzas  my girlfriend and I decided to go light and start off with the Burrata caprese salad  which was out of this world.  It was made with organic roasted cherry tomatoes on the vine  a touch of pesto and a balsamic reduction.  We then moved on to the Chef special- Chilean Seabass  which I really hope becomes a permanent item on the menu because it is now my new favorite dish.  It was served with a bed of some sort of celery root sauce  caper vinaigrette and fried artichokes. It was truly sensational.  Although I am a wine drinker  I couldn't resist ordering the Delirium on tap.  What a treat to have such a delicious triple belgian ale on draft.  It goes well with anything  but I would highly recommend it with the fish special.  For dessert  we ordered the mocha semifredo which came with a chocolate toffee crust. It reminding me of being in an outdoor cafe in the middle of Spain. It was truly delightful.  This restaurant is exquisite and I will definitely be back (hopefully on a date next time).,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0
08k0jjos42MrcMxtiOlPxA,lbqQB3pI5GG73N5w44lmQw,2,5,3/5/2012,I visited Skylight Gardens during its soft opening and was extremely impressed with all that this new restaurant has to offer!  The food was truly above and beyond any Italian food I have ever had  with the pasta being the highlight of the menu for me.  Regarding the staff and management  I was very pleased with the cordial service and will definitely be returning.  Before being seated I checked out the bar and noticed a very extensive selection of beer  wine  and assorted cocktails to choose from.  Additionally the bar is complimented by 2 massive flat screens that are great for watching sports on. The restaurant is beautifully designed and provides a nice atmosphere for dining  but the food is what makes this place special.    I ordered the Lasagna Bolognese and also tried the Fettuccine Bolognese and Gnocchi Pomodoro  all of which were absolutely amazing.  I can guarantee that you will be hard pressed to find any Italian food in LA that compares to the great taste and quality of these dishes.  The meat sauce used in the lasagna and fettuccine dishes is incredible  and the gnocchi is unbelievable.  I didn't really leave much room for dessert  but still ordered the tiramisu and devoured it. One of my friends ordered the cheesecake and said it tasted great as well.    Overall I highly recommend Skylight Gardens because it is a top choice for Italian food  particularly the pasta.  The menu has an extensive selection to choose from  the service is great  and the restaurant's concept is implemented well.,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0

It seems like they are still working on their menu since the menu has changed within the two weeks I was there. I love their wine selection  but their cocktails were just alright.  The bread is just alright. It either comes out cold or over baked and a bit charred.  I love most of the appetizers. I would recommend most of them.   The pasta is excellent! I would like to try all of them! I would recommend the truffle one. The spaghetti carbonara is a bit salty but still tasty. Pasta is a must for this restaurant.   I don't like the desserts. Most of them don't have proper texture/taste of what I expect of each dessert. The cheesecake was warm and very gritty. The creme brulee was lacking a sugary and creamy texture. The coffee mousse has a bad taste of improper storage and uneven folding. The chocolate torte was lacking a deep chocolate taste and was not warm when it came out. The texture of the cake was very sandy instead of soft. This happened both times that I was there for the desserts.   Excellent service: yes Excellent drinks: soso Excellent appetizers: yes Excellent main dishes: yes Excellent dessert: nay Total: 3.5   I give this place a 3.5 stars because the desserts were very lacking and some of the cocktails were just alright.""",0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

I work in the area as well  and 2 friends and I dropped in on what I think was opening night (2/17). It wasn't particularly busy  but they were extremely friendly. We had their hostess and their mixologist"" greet us at the entrance. After seating us  our waitress took our drink orders very promptly (they have specialty drinks named after various L.A. and Westwood landmarks (e.g. ""The Hammer"" and ""405""). After we ordered  the food came out so quickly that we and our waitress were all surprised. It felt like 5 minutes. The food was piping hot and very tasty. I highly recommend any of  their pastas that are handmade. My friends got ravioli and gnocchi  and both were amazing. My chicken was good  but comparably it made me wish I had gone with the pasta as well. During our meal the mixologist came by and talked about our drinks with us and while we were paying  another waiter/bartender came by and just made friendly banter with us. We definitely felt like we were getting a lot of attention. I can understand that maybe they were giving it 150% on opening night  but that was my experience. I usually refuse to go anywhere right when they open for the fear that their service will suck  so I was happy to be wrong this time. If things are worse next time I go  I will update my review accordingly.""",1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1
08k0jjos42MrcMxtiOlPxA,DI1sXJs9vzMy4Q9f9L9E7A,3,1,4/17/2012,Not sure how this place prides itself on Italian food!  I have been here 3 times and its just not worth it.  My building is right across the street so this place is very convenient for people in my office to go too and for me to send my boss and his clients too but I wont recommend them!  First Visit:  Lunch time and I got the lasagna bolognese.  Not good.  The whole thing was bland and just there!  There was nothing appealing about this dish what so ever.  Second visit: Again Lunch time I got a steak and fries.  Their steaks are great.  The only thing I wish they wouldnt do is pre-cut it for you.  When you do that you lose all the juices from the steak and it becomes cold quickly.  Third Visit:  We went for a dinner.  There were 7 of us.  I already knew I did not like their Italain food so I got the New York Steak.  Which again was great just wish they wouldnt pre-cut it.  2 other ladies got a grilled chicken w salad and they said it was good.  The other ladies all got Italian food and it was not good at all!!! None of them finished their plates.  They had to add salt and cheese just to give it some kind of flavor but even then that didnt help that much.  If you are going to go with Italian food you gotta make it right and make it taste good.  I think they should switch to a steak place because how they are going now they wont last.  I will refer anyone over to Teninos on Westwood for Italian food before I send anyone here.  Such a shame because its a great building and atmosphere.,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0

At 12pm  they weren't too busy and we were seated immediately.  Service was good for the most part. The only hitch was when they were a little slow with a parmesan request for one of my coworker's dishes.  As for the food itself  this is where they lose most of their stars. I ordered their steak panini with mixed greens as a side. I actually did enjoy the salad and it wasn't overdressed. The panini itself  however  was incredibly meh."" It had all the things I liked: steak  mushrooms  bell peppers  gruyere. However  it was oversalted and the flavor was very one note  except for the gruyere which kept it from being totally one note. Bread was warm and toasty  but the texture was a bit too chewy for a panini.  Which reminds me  the bread they serve you before your meal is cold  halfway to stale  and just no bueno in general.

08k0jjos42MrcMxtiOlPxA,3iRSV95lS_nvMOr5_-vbYQ,6,1,8/5/2012,"I sincerely hope that my experience at Skylight Gardens is atypical. If not  the place needs to have an overhaul in staff and an update in food quality. I went with a small group from work to celebrate the birthday of one of our coworkers.  Venue: The building and interior are beautiful. I really enjoyed the view and had I not been so irritated by everything else  I would have filed this place away as a good location for intimate dinners. Whoever made the choice of decoration did an excellent job.  Food: The food is clearly supposed to be Italian fine dining  but it was mediocre. I wasn't very impressed with what I had - the filetto triplex. The filet wasn't prime"" as described on the menu. It was chewy and kind of stringy - these are not qualities of good filet mignon. My coworkers did not comment on the quality of their food. We're an expressive group  and I know from experience that if the food had been good the responses would have been vocal. The overall impression I received was a resounding ""meh"". The one thing that was loved was the tiramisu and the cioccolatissimo. The kitchen was out of the dessert I wanted  so I ordered the key lime pie instead. The overwhelming flavor was of powdered sugar. I understand this is a new menu item. Hopefully  it will be improved as time goes on. The price of the food isn't in line with the quality. I (and my coworkers) will gladly pay more for excellent food. In this situation  I felt as though I was drastically overpaying. It was disappointing.  Service: This  in addition to the mediocre food  is what made my experience so frustrating and simply embarrassing. The general dining room and private dining room were empty when we arrived. I requested a table for seven from the hostess. She was very nice  but her actions sucked. We were sat at a table shoved up against a tree/large plant and at the entrance of the restrooms. This is the worst table in the house. Two of our group (including myself) had to sit with leaves attacking our heads and face for the entirely of the evening. We were also not given the correct number of place settings and chairs. 6 =/= 7. The hostess repeated my request to me  so I'm not sure how she miscalculated.  Two members of our party weren't present when we arrived. I specifically asked the hostess if this was a problem  because I understand some restaurants do not like to seat incomplete parties. We were assured it was ok. The restaurant was EMPTY. Our waitress seemed irritated from the first moment we met her. She was definitely trying to act like she wasn't put off  but she wasn't a great actress. We ordered our drinks and waited for our coworkers. By the time they arrived and were sat  there were maybe two other tables in the restaurant and an abundance of staff. We were basically ignored for around half an hour when someone from our party flagged down a busboy and told him we wanted to order. Other tables did show up  but at no point during the evening was the place crowded. The food took a long time to get to our table. Even with two steak dishes  it shouldn't have taken as long as it did. When the food finally arrived  we were one dish short. WTF. This is a formal dining restaurant where staff uses crumb sweeper/brushes  and they deliver food without bringing the entire order? Of course it was the guest of honor's food. We all waited awkwardly until the final meal was delivered. The waitress apologized and brought attention to the fact that it was the ""birthday girl's food"". Ugh.  The waitress continued to neglect our table. One point in her favor is that she brought out a dessert with a lit candle for the guest of honor. I'm not sure if she did this on her own or if she was asked to do so by one of the members of our party. Either way  it was a nice gesture. We ordered additional desserts and were then promptly forgotten by the waitress. We literally sat for ANOTHER half an hour before we had to flag down a staff member for our check. A few members of our group were shocked to see that the waitress included a 20% gratuity to our bill. At that point  I would have paid anything to get the hell out and never return. I know I wasn't the only person who felt that way. Other members of our group are more vocal. One went to the manager to discuss the situation. We were told to come back and he would ""take care"" of us. More discussion was had. We were willing to pay a lesser tip amount  given that the service wasn't just sub-par it was almost nonexistent. Eventually  the tip was taken off entirely. At no point did the manager come to our table to see what had happened or to apologize for the behavior of the waitress. The staff was very obviously aware of what was going on  because we started getting dirty looks. The waitress came by to settle our bill repeatedly once it was given to us - we literally saw her more times when she wanted us to pay than we did the entire night.  Overall  horrible experience and meh food. No reason to return.""",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0

The bartender was charmingly friendly and efficient. Two beautiful fireplaces and a magnifcent antler chandelier further warmed its old world charm in the bar and adjacent dining room.

But imagine them on a fresh crusty French baguette and you have a slice of multicultural  hapa-food heaven. We have the French colonizers of  Vietnam to thank for this tasty adaptation of the traditional sandwich. I only know a few places in LA where you can get it. And East West Sandwich is pretty good. The sandwiches are huge and inexpensive. I usually make 2 meals off of one. The menu has a huge selection of twists on this classic - you can get an Indian curry sandwich  or a Korean kim chee version. I always stick to one of the 5 Vietnamese classics. The marinated pork is my favorite. The pork sausage one is very traditional and good. The atmosphere of the place is more take-out than sit-down. But you can also get a boba tea here (this used to be a boba tea place) or order off the menu of the Noodle Planet next door  (I think they must be co-owned).,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0

0gE8y94ytFFdFDDNon-K0g,xm_JZsyeZBLb8-oiPAWSvg,6,3,4/9/2012,"WAIT FOR IT............        Meh. I'll admit that I went against my own rules and started to get excited when I briefly read over the reviews of this place. I should have remembered the location..it makes a difference. I came here craving some Indian food after celebrating Holi (celebration of the beginning of spring) at Standford this past weekend.   I got the chicken Tikka Burroti (okay  that was slightly clever) and my friend got essentially the same thing but in the box. My overall experience was that although it had a slight reminiscence of the flavor you would find in chicken served in Indian restaurants  that's where the 'Indian' part stopped.  I didn't find any of the flavors to be exceptional or anything that stood out in a good way..  The girl at the counter who made our meal took an extremely long time to make our food. She chatted (flirted) away with a customer and moved excruciatingly slow. The worst part about her service was when she asked the level of spiciness we wanted  we said medium"" (assuming she meant the sauces that we thought were coming next) she then proceeded to dump A LOT of peppers onto our dishes. Only after she did this she then says  ""oh..just so you know these are Serrano peppers. They are really hot"" ( no...sh*t?!) If that's what you were going to do  why didn't you say so? It was too late by that point and I was frustrated and hungry so just paid and sat down to eat.   All the ingredients were piled on top of each other. The whole idea of Tava can be compared to Chipotle. From the way you order to what you can order. With the exception of beef not on the menu due to the fact it's against the religion in India. (Similar to Pork with Muslims)   The Good  The Bad  The Ugly:  - raita (yogurt) that comes on the side needs seasoning.  - Roti is not Indian Roti. My guess is it's a flour tortilla? It didn't look like either to me. Although I don't think you'd want to be eating real roti with chicken..it just doesn't flow together so I guess this was an okay replacement. -Chicken did taste fresh -Watch out how many peppers you ask for or you will end up with a NUCLEAR burroti that will burn off your taste buds for a week.  -The burroti had to be eaten with a fork as it couldn't be held or it would have otherwise spilled everywhere thus defeating the purpose of ordering that vs. the bowl - On the 'cheap' side? two meals  one drink under $20. I GUESS that's good for PA? -Clean interior design (sleek wooden floors  I was diggin' it)   Don't get me wrong  I love me some spicy Indian food but I walked away with a mediocre experience  a friend still hungry  and my poor taste buds completely sizzling and not in a good way. I know this place is new and has kinks to work out but I don't see myself coming back unless improvements are made. One star for the food though not great  it was definitely edible  one star for the outdoor seating  and one star for trying to bring some culture to PA.""",1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0
0gE8y94ytFFdFDDNon-K0g,zsEsm9-bTEMWf1x07dWKnA,1,4,5/24/2012,"I give a solid 3.5 stars to an interesting business idea. Tava Indian Kitchen is an intriguing concept. The small restaurant is tucked away in the back of Town & Country Village. It has ample outdoor seating at individual tables but there is no indoor seating whatsoever.   The employees at Tava are very nice and will be happy to explain the entire menu to first time customers (just let them know that it's your first time). However  the menu is pretty straight-forward. You either choose a burrito or a bowl"" - filling either with one of two rice options (basmati or brown)  a main item (chicken  lamb  or paneer)  and then add on as many toppings and sauces as desired. The entire bowl was about $7. I went with the bowl of basmati rice and chicken with tikka sauce on the side. I also added some cilantro chutney  cucumbers  and tomatoes to my bowl. The chicken was a little too salty for my taste  but the rice was very good. I think that cucumbers and tomatoes are strange options to mix with Indian food. In fact  their entire toppings bar needs to be rethought. Mango chutney would be a great addition.   After paying  the woman gave me an Indian coin and asked me to drop it off in one of two jars on the island counter - one jar was for excellent service and the other was for subpar service. I thought this was cute  albeit a little foolish. I mean  who is going to put the coin in the subpar jar with the employee standing 3 feet away  watching your every move?  Overall  Tava was a good experience. I probably won't venture back there more than once this summer  just because Indian food is a little too heavy for my lunch palette. Nevertheless  I appreciate the interesting business model and I'm glad to have them in Town & Country.""",1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0

We love Indian food and burritos so I headed out to grab a couple of their Burrotis.   I expected the place to be a restaurant and was surprised to find that it is really set up to be a to-go place. Fine by me since I was getting my food to-go anyway.  First impressions were that the Burrotis were quite tasty. Like an Indian food flavored burrito. I was expecting it to be more saucy and more curry flavored but it was still quite good. (If I go back I'll ask for extra sauce.) My wife made the mistake of removing all the foil wrapping from her's and it popped apart. If you want to pick it up to eat it keep just remove the foil as needed as it is all  that holds them together. Watch out for the chilies as they are quite hot. I like spicy but not that spicy. (If I go back I will not get the chilies.)  Along with the 2 Burrotis I got and order of Naan chips. The chips were quite tasty and came with a little of the chutney they use on the Burrotis but charging $2.00 for a tiny handful of chips was a bit out of line. They should be included with the meal.  The 2 Burrotis and bag of chips came to a little over $18.00. Not a bad price these days but a few dollars more than I felt the meal was worth. If they knocked a buck off the price of the Burrotis and included the chips for free I'd be a regular customer.  3 stars for being very adequate.

Everything is fresh and made to order right in front of you.    The concept is similar to Chipotle in that you can do either a burroti or a bowl.  There are a number of sauces  vegetables etc you can add.

The concept of the restaurant is that you make wraps made with Indian flavors rather than Mexican. Quite simple. They currently have two meats (chicken and lamb) and chickpeas as fillings. They have two sauces  one a tikka  and the other a daal (lentil). On my two go throughs of the line  I tried the lamb with a medium spice chutney (cilantro) in a wrap. It was a good level of spicy and quite flavorful! On second go through  I got the chicken and tikka in a rice bowl with the spicy chutney. Also quite good  though I think they should consider how they ratio the rice to other ingredients in the future.

This place is too high-on-concept and low-on-tasty-food ... this might work in San Francisco where people hype everything up but not in the south bay  Lastly  no I am NOT a big Chipotle fan or anything  but the whole concept of Tava Indian seems derivative of the Chipotle experience and so I felt it was fair to compare to it  ++end negative rant++  Do give it a try and see what you think""",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

To make it simple  Tava= Indian Chipotle   Yeah  you read right! This is a college student dream come true !   They serve 2 types of things:   Indian burrito or bowl. The bf told the waiter to make whatever he thought was best  and he made us a half chicken tikka masala and half paneer bowl ( my apologies if I'm spelling this wrong) .  It was SO yummy! Really good Indian flavors. They serve naan chips with 3 different types of sauces ( tamarind  mint  and one more that if forgot lol sorry) my favorite is the mint! they are all really yummy though.

0gE8y94ytFFdFDDNon-K0g,bIgBpE4FebQBWj42rOPLsQ,1,1,6/30/2012,"Indian Chipotle? I agree with that description when it comes the concept of what they serve and how they serve it  but their food is nowhere near Chipotle's standards. If you want to spend $6.99+tax on a burrito (or $7.99+tax for lamb)  do yourself a favor and drive a couple minutes more to Stanford Shopping Mall where a new Chipotle has opened up for better food and service.  There is an assortment of toppings and fillings for you to choose in an assembly line - not so different from Chipotle. My burroti break down is as follows: paneer and garbanzo beans  tikka  raita  lettuce  cucumbers  onions  and tomatoes. It was huge when the server finally finished adding all the toppings. While I do find the price to volume ratio fair  I can't say that the food itself is worth what they're charging. Their seasonings are barely above those of a frozen TV dinner you can buy at Safeway. While the ingredients are fresh  the way they use spices ruin the experience of the food. I barely ate a quarter of my order before I gave up. The rest  I am sorry to say  went to the trash can.   In short  the volume of food is more than fair for the price  but the quality of the food is not. (but really  you might as well go to Chipotle or a decent Indian restaurant instead)  Food aside  I'll tell you all an anecdote of the service and busybody customer and the main reason why I'm never coming back to this establishment.   I'm a food blogger (currently on hiatus because I'm studying all summer long) and I love taking photographs. So naturally  whenever I go to a new restaurant  I take photos. Usually  I simply use my iPhone at the restaurant to take photos of the interior if it's not a sit-down restaurant/if I'm getting take-out. I do this to be more discreet  so as not to bother the other customers and so that I'm not trying to maneuver a DSLR while paying for my food. Later  when I go home  I take photos of the actual food with my DSLR for better effect.   So today  I went to Tava around 8PM and I quickly took two photos of the store front from the outside with my iPhone before going inside to order. I ordered my burroti and then started taking photos of the inside - including their ingredient assembly line. I was just about to take a photo of their menu that is posted on the wall behind the cash register when one of the customers who had already ordered  a middle-aged woman  interjected and said I don't think they appreciate you taking photos."" I stopped and stared at her for a moment  a little surprised and honestly  a little offended that she would have the nerve to say something like that. After a moment  I asked her if she was serious because some people have weird senses of humor and I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt. But then she said yes and went on to say something else that I don't remember.   At that point I was a little annoyed and I looked back at our server to see what he would say... he proceeded to give me some spiel about how maybe it would be kind of offensive to certain restaurants if customers came in and took photos because it would be like taking their concepts (really? concept? Tava's entire concept is a rip-off of Chipotle's). Then he backtracked to say that he wasn't in any position to make any decisions and it wasn't up to him in the end. The woman who started this whole incident had left by then.   I don't like making a scene in public and this certainly wasn't worth a confrontation so I just shrugged and smiled and put away my phone. I didn't even bother saying anything. In hindsight  I probably should have asked to see the manager to directly ask if it was okay to take photos inside Tava. But  as I said  I didn't want to make a big deal out of it in public so I finished ordering my burroti  paid  and left.   I'm honestly really disappointed in how the employee handled the situation because I have never had a problem with taking photos in any restaurant I'd been to - using either a camera phone or camera. Perhaps I should have been more polite and asked if it was all right to take photos before starting to do so  but... it wasn't as if I was taking photos of the people inside (there was only two people there when I went) or holding up the line (there was no line). If this had been even a one star Michelin restaurant and the waiters were concerned about my photo-taking disturbing other customers  I would understand. But this was not even close. And really  I just don't understand why that woman felt the need to interject in the first place when it was none of her business because I was not taking photos of her nor anywhere near her.   My experience with Tava ends here. If I'm going to Town and Country for lunch or dinner  I would rather go buy a pre-made salad at Trader Joe's. You could not pay me to come back here. To new customers and old customers alike  I sincerely hope that your experience(s) with Tava will not be as disappointing or as upsetting as mine.""",0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0

Yelp to the rescue! There was only one restaurant open that would satisfy my needs (and not cost a fortune) - Tava.  Walking in I found the place to be set up similar to Chipotle  you go to the counter and they customize your order while you wait. I chose to go with a paneer and garbanzo bean rice bowl topped with daal and all the veggies they would give me. It was a lot more food than I was expecting  but I was really impressed with the taste. Sadly the naan chips weren't in yet so I couldn't try them out.  Perfectly priced (probably too much food for one meal) and fairly healthy food. The owner was really friendly and introduced himself.

But I have to say  as others have pointed out  the amount of food in the burroti requires a larger wrap. Watching the staff roll your burroti right in front of you  where their fingers literally need to go inside the wrap for execution  is really unappetizing. It is a total mess for the staff to make  and is an equally crazy mess when you eat it.  The naan chips need to be re-designed.

Since  I work walking distance from Tava  I knew I was going to try this place eventually. I was also unsure on how well an Indian fast casual restaurant can function  but their menu is quite simple. The restaurant is based on three options. The choices of meal are: a rice bowl  a salad or a buroti. These are not traditional Indian dishes  but they work for the fast food concept.  I chose the buroti. After the choice of the given meal  proteins are chosen for your meal. The choices for proteins are: chicken  lamb  or paneer(an Indian cheese). Next  is the sauce choices of either tikka (tomato base) sauce or daal (lentil base). Then  there's a choice of spiciness  which runs at mild  medium  and hot. Finally  toppings can be added in the end. The toppings are: lettuce  tomatoes  onions  cucumbers  and chilies. One could add sides like chips and drink to their food.  My buroti was a mild chicken tikka with everything except onions. The buroti was delicious  but I found a few problems while eating my food. The food doesn't taste like traditional Indian food  but makes it to be acceptable for palate to most people. There was way too much sauce in my buroti. So  as I ate the food  the buroti began to fall apart. As kept eating the sauce and juices dripped all over my eating area. By near end of my meal  it seemed that the buroti was product soaked sauce.    The place looks really clean and modern  but not a comfortable setting due to its space. I will definitely come again  but maybe have them ease up on the tikka and mild sauce.,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

The line was fairly short but it took forever for them to make the food. Really slow service. There is no seating inside unless you want to stand at the tall table to eat. The tables outside could use some umbrellas for the weather. I feel this is more of a to-go place.   My burroti was pretty good. I found it odd that Tava's motto is ""Demand more flavor"" and yet my food wasn't very flavorful. If there was no tikka sauce I would barely taste the chicken.   Despite this  I wouldn't mind coming here again if I was sick of chipotle. But I would take my food to-go.""",1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

The person at the counter started helping us  but then immediately looked at her watch and called to the back that it was time for her break.  There was no one else in the restaurant  and it would have taken her about 1 minute to make a Burroti.  She proceeds to make my wife's Burroti in a rushed and incredibly sloppy manner.  Let's just say that during the process  her fingers were all over the inside of the Burroti  and after the process  there was sauce dripping off of the foil wrapper on the outside of the Burroti.  The entire time  she was complaining to her colleague who was helping me (he was actually nice) about how hard she was working  and completely ignoring us  the customers.    Pretty rude service  and a pretty poor Burroti to boot.  In addition  the decor of the place is incredibly depressing (exposed pipes above  minimal decor on the walls) - just not a great experience all around.  I feel like there are too many other options in Palo Alto to have just decent food with a poor experience...,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

Succulent food (try the veal sweetbreads appetizer!)  excellent local ingredients  and just an all-around solid experience.   Their porchetta (think fatty  juicy pork) was amazing  as was their duck rillette (think savory duck grilled inside what looks like a hash brown).

As a single diner  I expect an attempt to seat me at the bar  and when I insist on a table  be offered something tucked away near the serving station or bathroom. You did neither. I was shown to a lovely  large table by the window  and the rest of the service was equally fabulous. The servers were charming  took my order promptly  and refilled my iced tea before I had to ask. Service was so attentive  that when the check arrived and the server apologized for the problem with my original server  I had no idea what she was talking about. Apparently  he had a family emergency and had to leave while the others took care of my table. I just assumed it was a everyone covers every table"" kind of place.   However  I was disappointed to see the menu on the website was not current and the actual menu was a bit limited. I loved the warm  crusty sourdough  although I found it a bit odd that it was just set on the table without basket or plate. My ABLT  had wonderful ingredients  with thick bacon  more of the wonderful whole-wheat sourdough  butter lettuce and a lovely yellow tomato  but the bacon wasn't crisp  the avocado a bit skimpy  and the bread not thick enough to absorb the tomato juices. I had to pull a long strip of uncrisped bacon fat out of my sandwich and the bottom bread on the second half fell apart into mush before i could eat it.

Unfortunately  our dinner was pretty disappointing for the price.   My fiance had the burger  which he had seen and been interested in when we came for brunch.   However  he didn't really care for it and said it was just kind of meh.  It looked very dried out to me  although I didn't try it.  The onion rings looked good  but he said they were blah also.   I was surprised the burger didn't have anything on it except cheese  burger  and lettuce and tomato.  For $14  you would expect some fancier ingredients.   I had the tagliarini with mushrooms and ricotta salata ($19).  It was ok  but nothing special.  I could tell the pasta was fresh  which was nice  but overall it was a pretty simple dish and the lemon flavor was a bit overwhelming.   For dessert I had the warm molten chocolate cake with salted caramel chocolate sauce and vanilla ice cream ($8.50).  Although I wouldn't describe the cake as molten (it was dense and warm  but did not have a liquid center)  it was very good and was the best part of the meal.   I love the sea salt/chocolate/caramel combo and this dessert was no exception.   They brought us a free loaf of bread with the check  which was nice  but the loaf was really burned and extremely hard (so hard that when my fiance playfully hit me with it  it actually really hurt!)   The people next to us got baguettes  which my fiance loves  so he was sad about that.  It wasn't a bad meal  but I don't think it was really worth the price.,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0

There are different kinds of chicken  you get what yo pay for...People who complain about prices should realize that owners have many choices when we decide what to cook for you and put into your body: a $12 chicken entree is most likely filled with hormones and anti-biotics  while at a place like this you pay $24  but it tells you the name of the local ranch it came from on the menu.

Great location. Luckily we got princess parking right in front so we didn't have to wait around for that  as I know that can be a problem.  We got seated right away. I love the decor of this place. So simple. We sat by the window to get some vitamin D ya feel?  I started with the Blood Orange Lemonade. It was really good. The bread that came out was still warm and hearty. Always a bonus.   I ended up ordering the Pork Sandwich  which was a pretty large portion. We also got the Onion Rings to share. Holy. They were spectacular. They were puffy and hand battered deliciousness. They almost looked like doughnuts. And you could tell the onions were fresh because I could actually cut it and not have the onion separate from the breading. So good. The sandwich was good but I couldn't finish it because it was so big. So I have lunch tomorrow! Yipeee!   I will definitely come back to try their baked goods.

The food is simple and tasty - really a 3 stars place  but somehow I find myself rooting for the Mayfield Cafe. My wife and I went here for dinner on a Saturday night. We both liked our own dishes but were not blown away by each other's food.  I really liked my farm lettuce salad and arugula-pancetta pizza  but she was not into my pizza. She really liked the pumpkin soup and the squash pasta  but I thought they were just average - well prepared with high quality ingredients  but nothing to knock your socks off. We both agreed that the brussel sprouts were great  and the Mayfield fries (garlic and parm-reggiano) were tasty.   Based on my view of other tables and a glance at the open kitchen counter  next time I want to order the Niman Ranch burger and maybe the lamb cheeks. Overall  I would go again.

I ordered a molasses ginger cookie ($1.70) and a non-fat latte.  Surprisingly  they ran out of nonfat and lowfat milk?!?!  The cashier acted like it was his first day there and that he had never seen a cash register before.  It took him forever to figure out how to ring me up.  He should have just asked for help or apologized.    The molasses ginger cookie was fine but too thin.  I like thick  chewy ginger cookies and their version was on the crispier side.  Flavor wise it was good; I like how it had a few but not too many chunks of ginger though.  The other cookies looked thin too.  They also had croissants  dessert bars and bread.  Everything looked smaller than average.  Not surprisingly  the prices are on the high side.    I'd rather have a cupcake at Kara's when I'm at Town & Country Village.,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0

I looked over the menu  briefly  but when our server said that the special for the day was fried chicken I was sold! One of my friends also had the fried chicken  and my other friend had the burger which she said was delicious.  Fried Chicken - excellently flavored with crispy skin and juicy on the inside. Huge portions  it was about half a chicken  served with gravy  biscuits  collard greens  and a nice salad that was light and refreshing.  The burger - came with onion rings that were probably the best onion rings ever!  Mini chocolate doughnuts for dessert!? YES PLEASE! We devoured them so fast we couldn't even take a picture! We also enjoyed the sticky toffee pudding which was FABULOUS! Something I had never tried before  so I am definitely glad my first experience was a good one!   It is a bit pricey  but what do you expect from Palo Alto? If I was in the neighborhood and had a few extra bucks to spend I would definitely stop it!  They also give each diner a complementary load of bread at the end of the meal! HOW COOL?!,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1
0LtFE_pQ9R0rXUknlnFGrw,KkG-fPph07BnqqFV8FBeig,5,4,2/26/2009,I had dinner here on a Sun. night with my husband and MIL.   I had called the day before to get a reservation  and found out that even though someone on this site said they take reservations  they actually do not.  Although  they do take call aheads.   Anyway...We were coming from Portola Valley  so I called about half an hour before we were hoping to get there.The woman I spoke to on the phone was really nice  and assured me it would be no problem to seat us when we got there.   When we arrived the restaurant was only about half full  and we were seated immediately. I did note that during the meal  the place filled pretty much to capacity.   Our server was young  but very nice He seemed to know the menu well  and was very informative (without being pretentious.) When my mother-in-law and I admitted we were having a tough time deciding on wine  he brought each of us out 2 samples. Very nice touch!!! We made a decision promptly  and were pleased that there were some reasonably priced wines by the glass.   We all shared an order of fries. I have mentioned in previous reviews that I am not a fan of fried food  and rarely eat it...With one exception. Fantastic french fries! Let me tell you  these were definitely great fries and between the three of us  not one was left in the bowl.  We were also brought out some fresh  hot rolls  which were incredibly good. When I eat bread in a restaurant  I prefer it hot  and this fit the bill  and had great flavor.   For my entree I had Arctic char. I'm a huge fan of this fish  and I don't see it nearly often enough on menus. Especially with salmon having the season it is...Come on restaurants! Get with the program! Sustainable fish is the way to go!  It was served atop a bed of cracked whole wheat  which tasted a lot like cous cous. It was something different  and I enjoyed it. I also appreciated that it wasn't drenched in sauce  just a light orange juice based sauce  with blood orange segments on the side.  The fish was cooked perfectly. It could have used a touch more flavor  but all in all  a solid dish. I really liked how light it was  and was glad that there was a fairly healthy dish on the menu.   As for healthy...It ended when we got the dessert menu.   After reading Randy's review of the s'mores dessert  I really wanted to give it a try. My MIL decided to order the Meyer lemon cheesecake  and the three of us shared the two desserts.   They weren't huge  so I was able to leave the table not feeling overly full.   The s'mores dessert was a little disappointing. It was served with a cannelle of chocolate ice cream that really added nothing to the dish   and wasn't very good.  With the rich chocolate of the s'more  there was no more chocolate needed on the plate.  As for the cheesecake  I have to admit  I am not a huge fan of cheesecake  it's just a too rich and dense for me. Although  this cheesecake was none of those things. It was light and flavored really well. I actually liked it a lot more than I thought I would.   The service was as close to perfection as I've experienced in quite awhile.   Even though the restaurant looks kind of fancy  the prices are not those of a chichi Palo Alto place. They do add up  but we always end up ordering more the first time we go to a restaurant. If we came back  our bill would be considerably lower.   As we were leaving  the hostess asked if we'd like some fresh rolls to take home. We didn't  but I thought it was a nice touch to offer.   In total it was a pretty good experience. The food was fairly solid  but I wasn't as blown away as I expected.   Since we ate there last week  the rating of this place has gone down. I figure  (as with most new restaurants) once they are open a little longer they'll iron out any obvious problems.,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1

How can you have a fabulous backing with such winners as the Village Pub and Spruce and screw up on this one?  I don't get it.  I still think they have much potential.  I have been there at least 8 times (giving them many chances to improve.)  Thursday night for dinner I had the chicken with polenta (had the consistency and flavor of cream of wheat) with tomato sauce.  It was FLAT.  The chicken skin as mentioned slid right off.

My wfe and I have been wanting to try this place for awhile but always seem to end up at Calafia cafe'  next door.  Either way  we made it a point to check it out today for brunch.  Cute  sort of country ranch/farmhouse feel to it.  It has a pretty counter/bar area for those who don't mind sitting and eating on a stool.  They also have a pretty extensive outdoor seating area which is always nice.  On to the food...  I had the Rotisserie Chicken Breast Salad wih butter lettuce  feta  almond romesco and meyer lemon vinaigrette ($15).  I liked it.  Chicken was fresh  lettuce was crisp and the meyer lemon vinagrette was snappy.  To be honest  the salad was more along the lines of something you would get for about $12.  My wife had the Pulled Chicken Sandwich w/brie and  applewood smoked bacon for $12.  She enjoyed it.  What's cool is that they scoop out the baguette bread and fit the pulled chicken in it  forming a sort of cozy pocket for all the ingredients.  The dish didn't come with fries so we ordered the Mayfield fries ($6) which were delish...they were fresh out the fryer and seasoned with what looked to be cumin or chili power and a either parmesean or romano cheese.  Also a bonus was the fresh loaf of sour dough bread they give you with your food.  I thought the host and wait staff were very friendly and antentive.  Perhaps they've made some improvements in that area due to all the poor reviews.  I definitely wouldn't mind coming back and trying them again.    Good stuff.,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

I ordered the oatmeal with fresh fruit (the waiter told me it was apricots  bananas  and berries). My partner ordered a flatbread dish which really was a thin pizza with lettuce greens. They were out of the beer she wanted.  The oatmeal came without apricots and maybe a total of 3 cut up strawberries and a half of a banana plus there were huge clumps of congealed oatmeal. All this for $10! The pizza  as I was told  was bland...ka-ching...at $14. My green tea was $6.75. That pretty much blew me away.

Good bread  good atmosphere  lots of potential  management has a track record of other good restaurants  but this place SUCKS. I guess you could say we are foodies  but we don't have to have the fanciest or the most elaborate dishes -- we do expect good taste. We have been to many great places that are creative  but what good is creative if presentation or taste are lacking?  We came here for dinner back in February and I had a polenta and chicken dish that was truly horrible. I nicknamed it band-aid chicken"" - if you can imagine the taste of a band-aid  you just took a bite of my dinner. The ""rotiserie chicken"" had a slimy skin and sat in a tasteless tomato sauce and some rubbery polenta. Not sure what chef would think that was a good idea.   We thought it was just too close to the opening  so we decided to give them another shot for brunch today. Bad move. The menu was expensive ($18 for a mixed assortment of bread and pastries?) and every dish had something that was way too experimental and I had a feeling they couldn't pull it off. I went safe and ordered the brioche with braised pancetta and carmelized apples. It was OK but not memorable. The pancetta was tasty but the portion size was tiny. I expect a lot more for the money and from this hip looking restaurant.  My wife also went the safe route and ordered the sour cream blood orange pancakes. Sounds good  right? Fluffly and full of flavor  right? Unless eating sheetrock is your thing  stay away. There was no flavor at all  and holy cardboard batman! By the way  if you want killer pancakes  go to Serpentine in Portrero Hill (San Francisco).   I would like to think that Mayfield can correct this  but I have been burned twice now  so I don't picture myself coming back. Calafia is right next door and much much better.""",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

Got here about 11:45 am & were seated & greeted immediately.  Now  I eat oatmeal/skim milk/banana for breakfast 5 days a week so I can enjoy a festive brunch every week or so. This did not disappoint! They make and bake everything on site. I ordered the crabcakes benedict (about $15) with wonderful hollandaise sauce. Favorite Family Member ordered the hash brown hill (crispy shoestringy potatoes with little chunks of crisp lean bacon and a dollop of creme fraiche) and a breakfast pizza (crunchy crust  prosciutto  fresh baby spinach  a baked egg in the center). I ate half the potatoes  a pinch at a time. We also enjoyed excellent lattes (me) and mochas (Family Member) served in oversized handleless china bowls. For dessert  we split a warm apple crostata with a modest scoop of vanilla bean ice cream (gelato?). Whatever -- it was perfect.   Excellent meal  surpassed my expectations. Excellent service too.

While I was shopping at Town and Country  I stopped into Mayfield Bakery. I actually passed up Hobee's because I wanted real"" bacon and I didn't want to spend $15 on breakfast. Mistake! I ended up shelling out $24 for a bland meal.   Upside: the eggs were cooked just right and I got the most delicious piece of gingerbread (included this day) while I was waiting for my meal. Staff was friendly and chatty.  Not so good: One slice of really dry and hard bread was not enough to sop up two egg yolks. The hash browns were glorified potato sticks like the ones Burger King and McDonald's hand out. The $3.50 house coffee tasted burnt.  The ultimate no-no: I was given a dirty coffee cup and no one offered me a clean one even while seen wiping dried coffee off the edges.   I probably won't return here. The meal was palatable but for the price I expect a little more flavor if not another slice of decent bread.

I stopped here quite a few times during my stay in Palo Alto  and it hit the spot!  I went to both the bakery and the restaurant.  The bakery is small and intimate.  TONS of freshly baked breads and pastries.  The chocolate croissant was amazing.  They also have quiches  and some sweets.  Along with a full coffee and tea menu  you can't go wrong for a quick breakfast stop.  The restaurant is a little fancy and upscale  but as far as I could tell...what isn't in Palo Alto???  The breakfast/brunch menu was very good and offered some classic breakfast entrees along with some more innovative fare.  I loved how the local farms and ingredients were listed for that days menu.  I opted for the classic breakfast (I wasn't feeling the adventurous vibe that day).  The bacon was the best I had EVER had...seriously.  A trip back is almost warranted for that bacon!  We also tried the Soft egg scramble with asparagus  prosciutto  and Meyer lemon nage.     The menu is pricey and probably a little fancy for every day.  I would like to go back for dinner and see what could be cooked up!,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0

0LtFE_pQ9R0rXUknlnFGrw,fzkOH55c6lOpjJGUjty2Ig,37,5,2/8/2009,The Town and Country Village in Palo Alto has another newcomer! Located next to the newly opened Calafia Cafe (from former Google Chef Charlie Ayers) Mayfield  the new rustic American resto from the guys behind Spruce  Pizza Antica and Village Pub  is here  officially opening to the public Monday (bakery on Tuesday). Trust me  if you love any of those places  you're going to love Mayfield. Chef Gordon Drysdale  Chef Andrew Hash and Pastry Chef Nancy Pitta have put together a brunch  lunch  dinner and dessert menu that will be sure to satiate any appetite. Prices are mid-range  which means I'll be coming here a lot more often than I get over to Spruce.   Mayfield is casual elegant  with service that is top notch but completely unpretentious. You might find the staff behind the bar or in the front of the house on different nights  and get a peek at the pastry chefs working around the clock through their open kitchen.   Everything I sampled was delicious  but standouts included the Niman Ranch Chuck Burger with a homemade poppy bun (it's just as amazing as the Spruce Burger)  spit-roasted pork shoulder  potato artichoke soup and beer battered shrimp and Niman Ranch bacon (which comes on one of their salads). Paired with a wine from their collection of 100 varieties or Belgian beer on tap  and you've got a perfect meal.  Make sure you don't skip dessert  all made in their in-house bakery  or just stop into the bake shop next door for some delectable cookies  cakes  fresh Italian breads and a cup of their house roasted coffee. Nancy's carrot cake is probably some of the best you'll ever have  and the cheesecake and chocolate torte are simply to die for.,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

0LtFE_pQ9R0rXUknlnFGrw,Rnj7s57lLdvoer-fbtppfQ,15,4,2/20/2009,Thank you Yelp and thank you Connie C. for the FTR...Mayfield Bakery and Cafe is a winner and we had a wonderful dinner there Friday night!  In this day and age of the recession with mostly half-full restaurants  it's priceless to find a restaurant that is bustling with a lively atmosphere  top-notch service  and fantastic food.   Granted Mayfield has been only open two weeks  but I have no doubt the crowds will not be disappearing any time soon.    With Calafia Cafe and the soon to be opening Trader Joe's  the Town and Country Village in Palo Alto suddenly seems like the newest hot spot.  Given I'm so close  I have absolutely no complaints about that.    We arrived with no reservations and at 8 pm  the wait looked to be about 45 minutes.  Luckily  we were able to snag seats at the bar and eat dinner there after waiting about 15 minutes.  With a unobstructed view of the open kitchen  I'd dare say the bar seats were even better than some of the dining room seats.  My interest was immediately piqued by the menu.  Rather than being a copycat of so many others out there  I found all the items on the Mayfield Bakery menu to not only sound tantalizing but be unique.  As someone who hasn't patronized their related restaurants Spruce and the Village Pub  it was something I appreciated and makes me want to seek out those two highly rated places even more.    Even the drink and wine menu was nice.  With a great selection of wines and beers  Mayfield also has great old fashioned soda pop and root beer floats.  I was so intrigued by the Purple and Black Cow drink items that I ordered the Purple Cow.  A chilled bottle of Grape Crush was mixed with delicious vanilla ice cream.  Mmmmmmmmm....  It may have been childish but felt oh so right having such a drink in a fancy and nicely decorated place like Mayfield.    We followed it up with a diverse menu selection and  honestly  nothing disappointed:  Smokey chicken soup - those who know me will be familiar with my frequent complaining about lukewarm or cold items.  No such problem here!  The delicious soup at Mayfield is served absolutely scalding hot!  The tasty broth is mixed with an olive oil and features tender  meaty chunks of dark chicken meat interspersed with carrots  veggies  and elbow macaroni.  Perfect.  I make a mean chicken soup but am going to steal a few tips from the version here.  Mayfield fries - delicately flavored with garlic and parmesan cheese  this dish is an easy hit.  I may have liked even more garlic  but then my breath probably wouldn't have been fit for company. (addendum: the complimentary bread is warm and crunchy.  served with delicious soft butter)  Lamb cheeks with pasta - although I find lamb to be a bit gamey  the cheeks were super tender and the star was really the pasta.  It was obvious the pasta was ultra freshly made and it really matched well with the meat.  Spit fire pork shoulder - The pork shoulder was cut into nice slices and was tender.  I expected a bit more fat  but it was still quite juicy.  The sauce accentuated the pork flavor and the entire dish was served with a bed of brussel sprouts mixed with pancetta chunks.  I'm not usually a fan of brussel sprouts  but I loved them here.  I have no doubt that the sauce  separated brussel sprouts and generously sized pancetta chunks made that all happen.    We finished our meal with a s'mores tart.  A unique play on the S'more  it featured a decadent chocolate topped on a graham cracker with a toasted marshmallow layer.  For a non-chocolate fan like myself  I still thought the dessert was quite good.    Sitting at the bar and so near to the open kitchen  I was able to see more of the server/manager interactions than the average guest.  This place is well run and it's no accident.  Attention to detail runs to spots on glasses  whether drinks are filled to the top  and whether plates are spotless when being served.  Despite the hectic crowds  our bar keep kept a close eye on us  recommended dishes  and made sure we were well catered to.   It may be early  but I think Mayfield is easily one of the best additions to the Palo Alto food scene for 2009  if not 2008 as well.  (Last year's Pampas was good too  but eventually too one-sided  [blasphemous for a carnivore like myself to admit that])    I look forward to returning to Mayfield and trying their brunch.  Admittedly  while Mayfield isn't cheap ($20 for entrees)  the stellar food  service  and atmosphere make it a winning entry.     Mayfield takes credit cards  including American Express.,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0
0LtFE_pQ9R0rXUknlnFGrw,T0uUVq1QKp9BDl1dSwsoDw,2,4,1/24/2012,"So I noticed that most of my negative reviews are long and droning whereas my positive reviews are short (yet sweet :) I'm going to try to give this one a good full review.  On our drive back down from the Winter Fancy Food Show in SF to LA we decided to take the longer 101-route instead of the 5. Surely enough we were nearing the signs for Stanford University and my mom decided that we should stop there for lunch. I didn't Yelp or search for anything  we just turned into the first plaza that we saw and drove straight into the Mayfield Cafe parking lot. Actually the first sign I saw was of CVS Pharmacy's  cause I needed to stock up on more cold medicine. Anyways  one of the first things we noticed was IT WAS PACKED on a Wednesday afternoon  around lunch time. Wow  we immediately said to each other  We need to try this place"". So we walked in and was greeted by the hostess who asked if we don't mind waiting another 10-15 minutes because they were super booked and had a back-wait of reservations. Or we could be seated immediately at the patio. It was a really nice patio but since it was cold and I wasn't feeling well I told her we'll wait. I immediately noticed how fashionable the men and women were  and even some of the older crowd were nicely dressed. We assumed that most were either part of the Stanford faculty and some students or we just happened to be in a very nice (wealthy) area.  15 minutes later we got to our table  the server immediately brought water and bread and was very friendly. He made his suggestions and then made sure that we got our food in a timely manner. I only ordered the butternut squash soup (which was so delicious I almost licked the bowl clean) because I was just not feeling too well. My mom got the Lunch Special which included a bowl of leek soup (also very good)  a tri-tip salad and a cookie from the bakery. I had the elderflower soda which apparently is made fresh daily in-house by the restaurant. The server told me that if I liked the elderflower that I would like the spritz (which is also home-made and he said is their best seller) even more. The server also thought that since I only ordered the soup he would bring out an extra plate in case I wanted to share my mom's salad. That was very thoughtful of him and I liked that he paid attention to those details. Though I didn't really use the plate  it was nice to have cause my mom end up portioning her salad and placed some on the extra plate anyways. The salad portion was quite large so our whole order was really more for 2 people. I tried a little bit of the tri-tip and the greens and WOW what a nice and freshly made salad.   You could tell that everyone there paid so much attention to the details of the diner's experience from the front of the house to the back. I liked that they had signs everywhere about their local farm-sourced ingredients that they use for the dishes. The bathrooms were nicely done and upkept. One of my pet-peeves is when a nice looking restaurant has a messy unkept bathroom. One of the smaller details that I noticed was these mirrors on the back rest of all the middle-of-the-room tables so that even if you are seated with your back facing the window you could still see the outdoors from the mirror  feel the nice sunlight and the busy-ness on the patio and sidewalk. It gives the restaurant a more airy and spacious feeling. I hope they keep up the all around great service. I would consider this place a neighborhood gem. If only I lived closer cause I would be coming here alot if I did.""",1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0

This could be greatly improved by improving their service. They have TOO many servers waiting each table  different people taking orders  dropping off dishes  refilling water  bringing your drink - it's distracting  confusing & of course  makes mistakes more common.   The food quality is high  but it will miss the mark at times because it's not cooked to order. For example  their delicious burger won't be cooked the way that you asked. Or something you ask for isn't brought promptly  so that your meal & the mighty dollars you spend on it aren't memorable in the right way.   At night  dining outdoors is made an ordeal because the light is so poor. It's not just my complaint  either  but my partners & our friends.

We arrived at 11:45am on a Weds  it wasn't too crowded so we were seated right away. The inside is a nice  simple decor but a lot of unpainted white walls which was a little strange to me.  Their menu is simple and small  which I can appreciate. I ordered a coffee  my mom had their Bombay chai - both were pretty strong but very tasty. I started off with their turnip and apple soup - very unique and very good. A little sweet when you first taste it but tempers out to a nice mellow flavor  smotth consistency. I ordered their pizza with basil and burrata (I fell in love with this when I had the smoked trout app at Franciscan - plug  plug ; ) ) and my mom ordered the chicken salad.   Our food took close to 40 mins. which was the most surprising part since they know people are usually on their lunch hour and then when our food came my pizza was cold. After thinking about this I actually don't know why this would be since my mom's order was a salad w/ cold chicken so that should have been the easiest to make and then there really isn't a reason that my pizza should be cold.... however the food was decent but for the price and wait I would not recommend it or go again.,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

So  it's all good  right?  Ha!  Justin sends me a confirmation email with the wrong date.  Then (1 minute later) sends it with correct date  but wrong time.

One of us had the Braised Short Rib; it was extremely tasty and tender. One had the Rotisserie Pork Chop; it was huge and very tender and tasty  nicely presented with butter beans. One had the  Bavette Steak  again  very good. The Warm Olives with Rosemary starter was enjoyed by all. In summary  if food were the only consideration I'd give this place four stars  even 4.5.  But our enjoyment of the food was reduced by the EXTREMELY high noise level. The room has harsh  bright acoustics so that during busy times it is impossible to talk across the width of the table without shouting  as everyone else is doing. If you have any hearing impairment or a hearing aid  you'll be effectively deaf.  The high ambient noise and inability to chat comfortably was underscored by the long wait for food. No bread to nosh on for ten minutes after we'd ordered. A 30-minute wait for the main dish after the salads were done.  And the prices are quite high: dinner for four  with only two beers and a half-bottle of wine -- and no dessert or coffee as we couldn't stand the thought of sitting around in the racket waiting for it -- was still $204. With a rather stingy $20 tip  $224. That's a lot for what we got.  Here's how to enjoy Mayfield Cafe: go on a warm evening and sit outside.

Many times  our waiters are unapologetic and totally apathetic.  Yes  there are some good servers but I rarely get seated in their section.  Here's a suggestion -- make sure all your servers are well-trained so it doesn't matter where I'm seated.  I am rounding up to three stars because the food is tasty.  It is definitely not my favorite place in Palo Alto.,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

They have an awesome assortment of bread and other condiments not to mention delicious desserts.

After a workout  I wanted to eat something light yet flavorful  which I got at Mayfield Cafe. I got referred here by someone saying that they make very good gourmet sandwiches and salads  even though the selection is not very big. They were right.  My friend and I ended up splitting a tuna sandwich and the chicken salad  which were both very tasty. The tuna sandwich was very interesting. I thought at first it was going to taste like a tuna salad sandwich  but the tuna was actually cooked all the way through  and was wrapped in an interestingly green colored sauce  along with hard boiled eggs and olives in a french roll. It's a pretty interesting creation  but still tasted good. The portion is not big though  so if you're hungry  you'll have to order something else too. The chicken salad on the other hand was a decent portion  and the chicken was extremely tender and tasty. Big fan of the salad =)  The decor inside is very simple yet elegant. There is also an outside patio area  which is nice when the weather is nice outside. The menu said August' on it so I'm thinking that it's seasonal and changes maybe on a monthly basis.  Have not tried their desserts or anything from the bakery yet  will definitely have to try it out next time!""",1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

Even if the whole bar is packed  she still manages to make everyone feel special and paid attention to. She is a gem. Her friendly  bubbly personality keeps us coming back time after time  and I trust her recommendations for food and wine. I will happily pay more for drinks and dinner if she's there serving. I wish the other bartenders were half as personable. I've also had Impeccable Service from all of the outside servers. They're both good spots to people-watch. I've actually had mixed service from the indoor table-servers--they seem enthusiastic but perhaps a bit inexperienced  and not as attentive as they need to be.  The food is great  a little pricey but you get what you pay for  nice selection of wines by the glass  and the atmosphere is unpretentious. Love the whole farm-to-table"" theme  but I think they've already achieved that with the white-washed wooden plank ceiling  butcher paper on the tables  vintage-look schoolhouse lamps  and warm mentions of farm providers in the menus.

If you bring your children for brunch  I recommend you have them order from the kid's menu  even if you don't believe your children are fussy.

We split the difference and ate in Mountain View--my mum and I came up from Monterey and my sister came down from the city for dinner at our favorite Mexican restaurant  Fiesta del Mar Too.  What the hell does this have to do with Mayfield Bakery? Well  while I was tasked with paying for dinner  my sister was tasked with picking up a cake. She chose a dulce de leche cake from Mayfield Bakery. Rather than getting a whole cake  she opted for individual slices--a good choice considering we were stuffed from dinner.  I was excited to try Mayfield Bakery  since I'd heard quite a bit about this spot and had always wanted to try their food--both the proper savory lunch/dinner menu and the sweet pastry/bakery menu. Sadly  I was rather disappointed in the cake. The cake itself was chocolate  which isn't my personal favorite  but to make matter worse  it was very dry. Seriously  this was one of the driest cakes I'd ever eaten--and that includes leftover birthday cake that's been sitting in the fridge for a week! The frosting was nice  very rich in flavor  but it too was dry and crumbly. And the dulce de leche filling had next to no flavor--it tasted like cheap caramel sauce  always a bummer for me. (Why do so many bakeries think they can just use caramel and call it dulce de leche""? True dulce de leche is so much better and such a unique flavor combination.)  I'm still holding out hope that their proper food menu holds promise  and giving them the benefit of the doubt with a three-star rating.

Quality bread (though I like Acme more)  tarts  pie  pastries  good coffee  and decadent hot chocolate with enormous iceberg like marshmellows.  A nice place for a quick breakfast before hitting the road.    As for dinner  I stopped in late one night on the way back from the airport.  I actually got turned away at Calafia next door a few minutes after their kitchen supposedly closed  even though there were still a lot of people there.  I haven't set foot in Calafia since.

I still regret not getting their pastry assortment as a starter  but thought after the complimentary  fresh baked apple cinnamon bread  I didn't need more carbs.  The bread wasn't anything exceptional  but it was good.  I was expecting a sweet cinnamon roll type thing with pieces of apple cooked (something i'd expect from a hi end bakery)  but it reminded me of pumpking bread - flat and dark orange/brown in color.  (i just removed a star)  My coffee was ok.  My cup was sitting in a pool of coffee in the saucer.  totally sloppy.    My friend ordered the French omelet which she was very good.  It looked like a real french omelette. I had the beef hash which unexpectedly arrived on a bed of creamy polenta  barley and topped with arugula.  I loved it all  but think the menu shoulda mentioned these things.  The poached eggs were overcooked.  ( I just removed another star)  I had a side of the cottage potatoes which were SO GOOD but i think they were overpriced.    The service really needs improvement.  We barely saw our waiter and when we tried to get more coffee  when i made eye contact with another server  he totally ignored me.  Then  they changed servers and the one hwo ignore me was our new server.  I'm glad our meal was over by then.  I did go to the bakery next door in hopes of a strawberry tart like their website suggests you do  but they had NONE.  was totally bummed  Will i go back?  yes  the entire menu looks good and I'll give it another try.

The soup was the consistency of milk  and the corn was blended in  so it was really a corn-flavored milk. The salad was a pile of yellow beets  an oddly bland horseradish yogurt sauce and some chopped chives. The dish tasted like water and plain yogurt. No flavor at all.

The menu lists the farms each entree's meat comes from  the prices indicate that the quality of food should be impeccable  plenty of chefs in the kitchen... The bread was great (best part of the entire dining experience  sad to say). I don't get where Mayfield went wrong but boy did it go wrong.  My chicken was undercooked so much that I worried about eating it. BF ordered a pasta with pesto made from walnuts (handy trick  the cheap alternative to pine nuts) and there was absolutely nothing reminiscent of pesto in that not-to-mention TINY dish!! AND it was around $20! If you're going to make pesto the fiscally conservative way  you better pay it forward and take the price of that dish down AND it better taste like pesto. Blah! My friend ordered a pizza that looked good but she didn't seem enthralled by it. Her husband ordered some lamb dish and his serving was incredibly small. Dessert... I don't even remember what I ordered  bad sign!  We all dropped around $30-40 each for a meal that was just terrible! That's wrong  shameful even.

0LtFE_pQ9R0rXUknlnFGrw,6coGlHnIGgwLgMdLa8eY_A,3,3,10/2/2012,Overall  this place is just okay. But to qualify  I've only been here for brunch.   Originally  I was so excited to check this place out because I'm tired of St. Michael's Alley. I think that's also just okay  especially because of the wait  but  thanks to Mayfield  it's definitely gone up in my book.   The biggest plus to this place is the nice outdoor seating (some bugs present  but hey  it's outside) and the single adept waiter (who looks like a poor man's Jeremy Renner). Trust me  I really wanted to like it more  thanks to the outdoor seating  but alas  it just wasn't to be. So here's a rundown:   - Brioche French Toast: The poached strawberries in syrup were the best part  but they didn't pack enough flavor to make the dish. The french toast itself was a bit bland  and it could've been rich eggy goodness. It was just okay.   - Country-style Cured Beef Hash: My first dish at Mayfield was a bit unimpressive. It was served lukewarm (at best) and some of the beef pieces were so hard that I couldn't bite through them. They were left on the place. The poached eggs didn't seem like they were drained well  so the polenta sauce ended up becoming this oddly watery mess. If the flavors were there  it would've been better  but it ended up being this bland soggy soup underneath really salty beef bits.   - Soft Scrambled Eggs  Foraged Mushrooms  Savoy Spinach  Parmesan Broth: Probably the best dish I've had  but I thought my eggs were too hard  and the whole dish was a bit wet. The wetness was amplified by the fact that the spinach was still relatively raw and crunchy  so it seemed like the textures were really at odds with each other. Really wet compared to really crunchy  not-really-cooked spinach. Don't get me wrong  the components were fine  but the dish wasn't prepared to express any cohesion.   - The Camino Breakfast: Everything was fine. Everything needed seasoning (both salt and pepper). I think the cottage potatoes are fun  and I like the creme fraiche with it.   - Giant Buttermilk Hotcake: It's pretty good  and pretty starchy (obviously). It's served with cinnamon-sugar butter  so that's a nice touch. I think it's better to share this with several people at a table  as opposed to just one person getting it (unless you really  really like your starchy breakfast foods).   - Mayfield fries: These are the hands-down best thing you can get here. They're served with housemade ketchup and this delicious aioli. Good amount of spice  too.   Coffee's pretty good. Beverages can be fun.   I still really want to like this place  so I think I'll try for an alfresco dinner. But then  that's it.,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

0LtFE_pQ9R0rXUknlnFGrw,bvCOShzk_Tst65TUQYKLTg,2,3,3/31/2009,"Oh  Mayfield  I want to give you a 4  but I just can't. I've agonized for three days about my review  but in the end  it's going to be three stars for now.   The story: My sweetie and I are big brunch fans and were headed to Hobee's Stanford. At the last minute  I suggested we try Mayfield. Surprisingly  at 2 PM on a Sunday there was no wait; we were in a booth near the bar immediately. After reviewing the menu (and asking about the scrapple)  we ordered the blood orange sour cream pancakes and the pork scrapple  with egg scrambled. Oh yeah  and a side of bacon. We also ordered iced tea  which was too tannic-tasting. Hey  Mayfield folks: either brew it for less time  or don't cover it while you're brewing it  if you're doing that. Covering results in bitter ice tea  which is what you all have.   My sweetie really didn't care for the pancakes. There was nothing terrible about them  he just didn't like the texture or taste particularly. I don't know that there was anything *wrong* with the dish; he's just determined that sour cream pancakes aren't his thing -- there's something about the aftertaste that he didn't like. On the other hand  he enjoyed the little sourdough rolls we were given.   As for the scrapple I had  well  some history. I spent some of my childhood in Delaware  where scrapple is a regional breakfast food. Basically  it's the pork scraps they have left over after making sausage  mixed with cornmeal and seasonings  and formed into a sort of loaf"". By scraps  I mean  like  heart  head  etc. I ate it as a child  but now that I'm an adult and I know what's in it  I don't. Anyway  there was a pork scrapple dish on the menu  so I asked what was in it. The server explained it was pork loin  roasted  then minced and mixed with corn meal  etc. So  it's a sort of scrapple-related  only not as freaky. Yay!   Okay  now that I've provided a little culinary lesson  the scrapple and eggs dish was okay. It was *almost* pretty good  but there just wasn't enough seasoning or flavor. Additionally  the egg -- which I'd requested scrambled -- was pretty wet  which I wasn't really feeling. Not enough of an issue to send it back  just -- not fabulous.   So  3-3.5 star food. *Different* food  *interesting*  but just not amazing.   Now  the service. If I had to describe the atmosphere of Mayfield in one word  it would be ""bustling"". I don't know if it was our booth location or what  but it seemed that there were a zillion servers and support staff  and they all circled the restaurant every 3 minutes. *rush rush rush  rush rush* Honestly  my gut reaction was that  there had been negative service reviews and someone had told the staff to be more proactive  check on diners more frequently  be more attentive -- and the staff was doing it  to a fault. It felt a little like everyone was trying just a *tiny* bit too hard.   So  here's my suggestion: everyone  take a deep breath. I know  I sound hella Californian  but I the anxious vibe with the service staff could be ameliorated if everyone just took a few slow breaths and centered themselves. (I swear  I don't believe I'm even writing this.) Attentive service is good service  but *great* service involves being attentive without being forced  without being a distraction. It's lovely to have my tea glass refilled just as it gets empty. It's not quite as lovely to be asked if I want a refill every 2 minutes.   The elements of a solid 4 star place are nearly in place at Mayfield -- I look forward to giving it another try  maybe for an early dinner sometime. (That burger looks damned fine.) In the meantime  tweak the seasoning  and relax  guys.""",1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

We had outstanding service from our host  waitress  server  and ancillary staff - even when they were busy.  If you can be seated outside it will be more quiet than indoors. It gets really noisy inside.  I really appreciated the unique menu choices for dinner as well as beverages  they all sounded so good. I went with the Strawberry Gingerade to start which tasted pretty good but I feel that it was overpriced at $6. Later during our stay I ordered an Elderflower soda which was quite good with a floral punctuation not only in aroma  but in flavor as well. The Elderflower soda was priced more appropriately at $3.50. My lovely wife had the Sour Cherry Limeade and enjoyed it very much. As expected it had a tartness to it that added to the experience.  We tried the salmon pate and the risotto  wild mushroom with proscuitto apps and were impressed with both. For dinner we had the roasted chicken which tasted good but was ordinary. The accompanying Italian butter beans and wilted greens were a nice touch. After asking our waitress to inquire about the source of the Yellowtail we were told it is wild caught in the bay area/off the coast of California. I enjoyed the tenderness of the yellowtail and accompanying seasonings but I will say that the lemon flavor was a bit strong. I do enjoy a bit of lemon accompany fish but on this dish it overpowered other flavors.  Bread pudding is an excellent dessert choice and the molten chocolate cake was quite pleasing too.

Burrata and Heirloom Tomato Salad  Basil  Aged Balsamic (pictured as split portion with the gnocchi) - Always having been a fan of caprese  the super soft burrata and the juicy heirlooms took this dish to the next level. A nice light summer appetizer.  Pan Seared Sea Scallops  Padron Peppers  Sauce Vierge (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0LtFE_pQ9R0rXUknlnFGrw?select=XmlSUH-c-G4rGdgfbGtn_g#18WRVt6_Yw3ijOt1Lgzj6w) - Crispy on the outside and almost rare on the inside  these scallops were cooked to perfection. The padron peppers had quite a kick to them and paired very well with the staple French seafood sauce.   Crispy Pork Belly  Apple and Radish Salad  Dolce Forte Sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0LtFE_pQ9R0rXUknlnFGrw?select=XmlSUH-c-G4rGdgfbGtn_g#1Y52xCMZ3ldMVQ9QrZwBRg) - Pork belly may be my favorite part of the pig  especially how Mayfield pairs it with sweet apples and bitter radishes.    Pine Nut Couscous  Ratatouille  Currants  Chickpeas (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0LtFE_pQ9R0rXUknlnFGrw?select=XmlSUH-c-G4rGdgfbGtn_g#tcl_iShrOo-dToycX_vIdg) - Generally I don't order vegetarian entrees  but this sounded intriguing and it was simply phenomenal. The acidic ratatouille sauce played really well with the sweet currants and there was a great crunch from the pine nuts and the chick peas.  Duck Leg Confit  Farotto  Roasted Figs  Mustard Duck Jus (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0LtFE_pQ9R0rXUknlnFGrw?select=XmlSUH-c-G4rGdgfbGtn_g#IWctA5B3kZitrizvCjqmeA) - By far my favorite dish of the night! The duck skin was crunchy  the meat was juicy and the farotto and figs rendered amazing flavors to the dish. Radishes and radicchio added a bitter note  making this dish pure perfection.   Braised Short Rib  Charred Sweet Onions  Grilled Peaches  Horseradish (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0LtFE_pQ9R0rXUknlnFGrw?select=XmlSUH-c-G4rGdgfbGtn_g#dt5Rly9e4VsfRRs5-D6uxg) - although full at this point  I scraped my plate clean. The rib was super tender and succulent. For my taste the peaches were a little overwhelming in sweetness  so I made sure to cut the fruit into very small chunks for each bite.   Triple Chocolate Fudge Cake & Tahitian Vanilla Bean Gelato (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0LtFE_pQ9R0rXUknlnFGrw?select=XmlSUH-c-G4rGdgfbGtn_g#XmlSUH-c-G4rGdgfbGtn_g) - We asked for the ice cream scoop to be dumped into an espresso  an Italian classic that I love. The cake was decadent  rich  and moist. Too bad I only had room for a couple of fork fulls.   The service was very attentive  the manager stopped by a couple of times for small talk and the wine pairings they served with our dishes were great. They even gave us a gigantic freshly baked loaf of bread to take home free of charge. That made for some great sandwiches and grilled cheeses in the following days!,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0
0LtFE_pQ9R0rXUknlnFGrw,DfDkyN9zrHCzjleUiLrXzQ,1,5,10/31/2010,We came here after work on Sunday night..  It was a light crowd due to the Trick or Treating  but there was still some steady business.  We had excellent service.  We never had to ask for refills - our server  the manager  anyone walking by was quick to top off our drinks  even the water which was available on the table.    We had an amazing appetizer - the ricotta gnocchi.  The ricotta was amazing.  After that  our group ordered the steak  scallops and bass.  The steak was perfectly seasoned  cooked to a perfect medium rare and the mushroom sauce under it was to die for.  The house made sour dough was perfect for sopping up the extra sauce and juices!  I can see where people could have a little sticker shock as the dinner menu is a little expensive  but it's worth it.  One might also think the portions are small  but the reality is that us Americans have inflated ideas of what a portion is supposed to be.  If you feel you need more food  a fresh side should fill you up.    The food is amazingly fresh.  The restaurant has their own farm that supplies a lot of their produce and they have close relationships with other local farms which means that the menu changes often and fresh is the focus.  The ambiance is quite nice and there is heated outdoor seating as well.    In my opinion  this place is worth a visit!  Support local businesses who support local farmers..,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1
0LtFE_pQ9R0rXUknlnFGrw,epG06947wKEYtvhtNLehhw,1,4,6/20/2009,We've come here twice now  once for lunch and once for dinner.  They have an area in front of the entrance where you can eat outside on the many pleasant afternoons and evenings in Palo Alto.  You have to close your eyes and pretend you're not in the middle of a parking lot though  so we've opted to eat inside both times.    I believe the owners are the same folks that run Pizza Antiqua.  On our dinner visit we elected to split a pepperoni pizza as an appetizer.  It's baked in a wood-fired oven and has a relatively thin  crisp crust and great flavorful sauce.  Maybe not as amazing as Antiqua's  but still very good.  For dinner I felt uncreative and had a burger.  Since Mayfield is right next door to Calafia  it reminded me of my recent experience with a really dry veggie burger there.  Mayfield's (beef) burger though came out juicy and perfectly cooked on a nice bun which was probably baked on site.  Mayfield 1  Calafia 0 in that contest.  E was served a colossal portion of fish for dinner which we consumed in its entirety.  Bread pudding dessert was also excellent.  Friends P and L enjoyed their meals also (great pork chop and a nice bowl of soup).    Mayfield also has a fun selection of old-fashioned and new-fangled soft drink beverages.  Grape Crush?  Not sure how many of those they sell  but it's there for you Grape Crush fiends.  You wouldn't expect to find an orange creamcicle float on the menu here either  but you can get one of those too (I had a root beer float which was a nice treat).    On our way out we were chatting by the entrance for a few minutes as the restaurant closed down for the night.  The manager came out with an arm full of their fresh-baked sourdough rolls and gave them to us to take home  a very nice gesture.    Overall - nice bright clean interior  good service and great food.  We'll be back.,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1
0LtFE_pQ9R0rXUknlnFGrw,KYnJ4cJBloIfrTWlzmn3QA,1,3,7/24/2009,Came in for a late lunch and was a little surprised that it was booming with people and traffic.  A great sign that business is doing well.  I reeeeeally wanted to give Mayfield 5 stars...the decor was lovely and food delicious  but for the price point they are sitting at (not to mention being related to The Village Pub) the service really missed the mark.  I could not believe our lackluster waiter.   I had the beet salad and warm turkey sandwich. Despite the fact that the turkey meat around the edge of my sandwich resembled plastic from it being over-(re)heated  the food had really great flavors.  I also had the carrot cake which was wonderful...that is  until I saw a hair in the caramel sauce!  Blech.  I know stuff like this is going to happen in any food establishment  but it really turned my stomach.  Coffee did not arrive until we were almost done with dessert which was unfortunate.  Actually  coffee service in its entirety was rather unfortunate.  Will I return?  Sure  but I think I'll give Mayfield a few more months to work out the service kinks.,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1
0LtFE_pQ9R0rXUknlnFGrw,Olj4Mx2li8zowfivIrt2EA,3,5,2/5/2012,This place definitely deserves more than 3 stars. My husband and I decided to check out town and country center for breakfast and walked into this place. The menu looks good  so we sat down. I order beef hash and he got a Camino breakfast. For the drinks  we got a Mocha and orange juice.   - Beef hash: was really good with lots of greens  carrots  barley (first time had it for breakfast)  potato and beef hash  topped with poached egg just perfectly. It's very healthy blend of everything. - Camino breakfast: I had the Han from my husband's plate and the potato hash is definitely more gourmet than what you get at IHOP. - Mocha: was served in a bowl  which seems to be a new trend I'm seeing in restaurants. it was excellently done with a nice motif on top.   I didn't have the OJ  so I assumed it was ok. The service was very good. We got seated at the bar  since the restaurant was full. It's good to make a reservation for Sunday. The food came very fast. The waiters were very attentive the whole time  more than I would expect from a restaurant and the hostess open the door for us as we were leaving. Everyone was nice and said good bye as we were leaving the restaurant.   Tap with tips was $45 for the two of us. Yes  it is on the pricy side for breakfast  but you get what you pay for. You get much better food and service than say IHOP. It's also one of those places lifted straight out of the city  which you don't find so often down in south bay. If this is what you are looking for and don't want to drive up  it's really as good as it gets.,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1
0LtFE_pQ9R0rXUknlnFGrw,2Ew-85tCOIeVQKvXCQHDQQ,3,1,10/26/2009,I suspect the cafe is always packed because  from the outside  the decor makes the location seem like a high-end eating establishment.  Unfortunately  service and food quality did not match the crisp white linens and shiny silverware.  The first time I tried going here  we waited for 10 minutes at the for a waitress to even notice us and put us down for a table for 2.  No one showed up  so we finally just left  feeling disgusted.  Willing to give this place another chance  the next time we went  we were seated immediately  but then forced to wait extreme amounts of time before they brought us bread  or took our order.  Since we were forced to wait almost 30 minutes for our food  we asked for a second basket of bread from two different waitpeople  which never arrived.  This place somehow manages to look like it's packed with waiters  but apparently none of them are doing anything.  I ordered a soy latte and the Florentine Benedict  and my friend ordered fries and a cappuccino.  My Florentine Benedict came out greasy and was nothing spectacular.  The latte came in the middle of our meal (which was strange  because you'd expect them to either serve it before  or after) and I immediately noticed that they didn't use soy milk.  Since I only picked soy for taste and not a food allergy  I drank the beverage  but you can easily see how this could have been a problem for anyone else.  By the time I drank to the bottom of the cup  I realized there was chocolate sitting on the bottom-- they didn't give me a soy latte  they had gotten me a regular mocha.  And given that all the chocolate was separated from the rest of the drink  not even a very good mocha.  Disappointing place.  A frustrating experience.,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0
0LtFE_pQ9R0rXUknlnFGrw,mLClrtpBD3abC9c7YRFYHg,1,3,9/20/2011,The restaurant: Delicious food  no question. I've been here for brunch and lunch and have not been disappointed with the tastiness of my meal. The only downside is that the food is definitely a bit expensive for what you get  and the restaurant's website doesn't clarify when the brunch/lunch/dinner menus begin. I went in on a Sunday at 3 expecting lunch  and was told that they only served a limited brunch menu. Which would be fine  the food's good  but they could stand to specify on their website.   Buyer beware- the hotcake and french toast on the brunch menu are ridiculously large  so plan to share these types of items! These foods definitely do not survive the next day reheating stage. They're also very sweet  so try some fruit on the side. (If you're willing to cough up $9 for a cup  that is.) The pulled chicken sandwich and chicken salad are both winners  though  and I may have to go back for them again.   The bakery: I've got a sweet tooth  and this place could definitely become a guilty pleasure. The lemon tart and s'more are fantastic  and it seems they have a healthy variety of breads. And if you order coffee you definitely get what you pay for- a huge bowl of it!,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0
0LtFE_pQ9R0rXUknlnFGrw,ku4Kp_e-46E2CpfaWJ2LyA,2,4,5/1/2012,I'm surprised that Mayfield only has 3 stars  I've been here several times and I've been happy with every visit.   They always seem to be busy  so I recommend making reservations on OpenTable although they do accommodate walk-ins. Mayfield has a great atmosphere in the evenings  with dim lighting and candles on every table.   One Sunday evening when we went  they had a dungeness crab dinner for two  so I believe they have seasonal dinner specials. I've tried the housemade tagliaraini with mushrooms  ricotta  and lemon  which was very good. My friend ordered the braised short ribs and she really enjoyed them.  The warm chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream was one of the better ones that I've had! I was impressed.  Prices for dinner entrees are ~$20-30  so not cheap but kinda expected for the Palo Alto area. The restaurant isn't fancy  so there are families with children as well as couples and larger parties.  I LOVE how at the end of every dinner  they give a complimentary loaf of bread to every person at the table. This is a nice touch and it always makes me happy as I leave the restaurant :D,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
0LtFE_pQ9R0rXUknlnFGrw,_iNAxk4IleJKkXbHZYfGSw,6,4,12/16/2011,"Very cute restaurant in an unassuming spot! Located in the Trader Joe's corner of the Town & Country Shopping Center sits Mayfield Bakery & Cafe. If you haven't yet been  I would suggest checking them out for brunch or lunch.  A good friend made the suggestion to dine here. She's staying in Fremont so it was a nice happy medium"" meeting spot. Be careful if you use Google Maps - they will NOT take you to the right spot. Just go to Town & Country (across the street from the high school) and you'll find it.   The menu is comprised mostly of locally-sourced ingredients  which is nice  albeit a tad expensive. Don't get me wrong  I like to know where my food comes from  but $17 for a chicken salad? That seems a little pricey  even for someone who's not on a budget! Plus  side dishes are a la carte  so you could easily spend $25 on lunch  not including tax or tip.   Prices aside  the food is really  really good. And service is impeccable. You know it's a nice restaurant when the servers come around mid-meal and remove the crumbs from the table with that razor-looking device. Fancy pants for sure! They also were not in a hurry to turn around our table  so my gal pal and I had plenty of time to visit. Had it not been so loud inside the restaurant  I would've stuck around and taken advantage of the free Wifi too.   Four starts  mostly due to the prices and the fact that the parking lot is insane. Anything close to a Trader Joe's is going to get dicey  so just park a little further away and walk.""",0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1
0LtFE_pQ9R0rXUknlnFGrw,NmZ_ik6SZcTJt75EdQG4mg,1,4,5/4/2009,Seems like there are a lot of reviews showing a lack of consistency.  I had lunch here today for two.  We arrived at 12:40 and were seated right away.  I ordered the Beet Salad & the Roast Vegetable Sandwich with a side of Onion Rings.  My wife had the Chicken Soup & Turkey sandwich.    First  the bread  Pain Epi was great.  There was no better that I've had on the Peninsula.  The crust was crisp but not too hard and the inside was soft and chewy.  Just the way I like it.  With that said  I wish they gave us more of it...  The appetizers arrived. The Beet salad had some yogurt dressing and what looked like onions but was probably thinly sliced napa cabbage.  Presentation was nice and the dish was very good.  However  the beets looked pre-prepared so the $10.50 price tag was probably a bit unjustified.  My wife said she liked her Chicken Soup very much.  The entrees came shortly after we finished our appetizers.  The server was in a rush and didn't clear our plates before putting the entrees in place.  There still appears to be some service flow concepts that need to be worked out.  The roast vegetable sandwich came served with potato chips and a small helping of green salad.  The chips were normal and the green salad was inundated with salt.  My wife's sandwich came with the same chips and salad (equally inundated with salt).  The roast vegetable sandwich was excellent.  The bread again was the centerpiece.  My wife said that her turkey sandwich was the best she's had in years.  The wait staff was unavailable to fill my ice tea at regular intervals.  I needed to ask but each time the matter was attended to.  The side of onion rings didn't seem to make it into our order.  We had to ask the server and she stated that she did not write it down.  When it arrived  it was perhaps the best onion rings I have ever had.  I am a huge onion ring fan.  Each ring was doubled and the beer batter was golden crisp and the onions were perfectly tender such that you bit through the entire ring.  There was no problem with pulling out the entire onion.  This is fine restaurant.  The kinks in the process still seem to be there.  Either that or the wait staff needs some more experience.  Will go there again and see if the food holds up....,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1

I would avoid the crab cakes for sure--I got a bad case of food poisoning from them.   My last experience was not as dramatic but convinced me that I need to find a better place when in the Palo Alto area.  I ordered soup and salad  and requested it be served as an entree.  The farm lettuces"" was a past its prime red lettuce that was overdressed in oil  and it appeared it had been sitting for a while.  The corn soup was lukewarm and too sweet--as if sugar had been added.  My guess is that even though requested as an entree  it was prepared as an appetizer and left to sit while the other entrees were prepared.   I had planned on eating some of my husband's roast chicken  but it was too undercooked for my tastes--one piece was pink and dripping blood. My son's pricey hamburger was in his words  ""forgettable.""   Then it came time for dessert.  My son ordered mixed berries with strawbery sorbet.  The sorbet was fine  the mixed berries  the first item listed  were actually three underipe blackberries  more of a garnish than part of the dessert.  My panna cotta was tasty  but runny.  My husband ordered coffee with dessert  but it was not served until several minutes after dessert was finished  so he ended up gulping it while the rest of us waited to leave.   They insist on having flowers with mostly eucalyptus leaves added in  which are highly allergenic for many people.  It seems they have a huge turnover  every time I have been  I notice an entire new set of waiters  even if in the same time frame as the previous visit.  What seemed to be a promising place for fresh  sustainable food has become an expensive disappointment.""",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0

In fact  it was good enough that I took my daughter back for dinner that night.    My mistake.  The restaurant is still going through an extended shake down period.  The place filled up by 7pm.  Our mussel appetizer came out quickly  but it was nothing special.  Then we waited  and waited and waited for our main course.  Finally the waitress told me the two? computer systems they use got one of our dinners lost/uncoordinated.  The result was our main courses showing up after 45 minutes.    The hamburger was good but a bit dry  the Arugula salad was OK.  They were nice enough to comp us for the entree  and having an articulate and up front waitress was appreciated  but I would rather wait another 6 months until they get their act together.

We had our first Mayfield dinner last week; I say it's going to be fantastic because they are clearly still working out some kinks in the service  but our food was delicious and the atmosphere was a comfortable step down from the fancier Village Pub.  I had the Beet Salad  Burger  Strawberry Lemonade and Coffee. All exquisite. My better half ordered Shrimp Crostini  Chicken Soup and Cherry Limeade and also gave rave reviews.  The kinks were material (e.g.  drink arrives 3/4 through dinner; we were graciously comped cupcakes for desert but then they disappointed because they were very dry; $3 coffee arrived when desert was over)  but I'm rounding up because I know they will sort these things out  ...so I did leave with a happy overall impression and a desire to come back soon for brunch.,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

I actually eat quite a bit of salt but when you have to send back a side of veggies because they are too salty  you got problems.  The grilled sardine appetizer was served room temp and seemed way too greasy. The onion rings are horrible  greasy and sooo salty that my 11 year old wouldn't eat them.  The only thing good about the place is the bread that comes from the bakery next door and the meat dishes. Though again  a bit on the salty side. We had the roasted chicken and a burger at our table. The burger got a thumbs up as did the chicken  though it was too salty. My nephew complained that his pasta was too salty.   All in all  they need to have a talk with their chef about turning down the salt.

I had the black bean dish which was unique and hubby had a turkey provolone sandwich  basically a grilled cheese sandwich for grown-ups. The service was marginable but since they had just opened we let it slide. Thought the prices were a bit high for what we received. Our second visit was for dinner with another couple. Needless to say we were ALL disappointed with the menu  the service and the price. The selection was sparse  the food we ordered was very mediocre and the price was shockingly high. We only had pizza  which was rather icky  roasted chicken which was dull and the Niemen burger which was only okay and very small.  My husband likes this place so he had talked me into taking him here twice since our dinner for that turkey sandwich he likes. One time they ran out?!?! and the last time they had completely forgotten about us all together. Our waitress was aloof and indignant about our meal. The menu hasn't changed since they opened and to me they have nothing to offer. I will never eat here again.

Here is my story:  I came here to pre-order a pumpkin pie for a holiday party. After a few days  I called in to change my order from a pumpkin to a pecan pie. There is a $1 difference and I offered to come into the store to pay. The owner told me not to worry about it and since then I have become a loyal customer here (well  I am quite easy to please!).  I have tried all the muffins here and they are very fresh and the sweetness is just right on the point. Latte is delicious and the roast beef sandwich is to die for (ask them to warm it up for you!).

It's an exceptional option on the peninsula for gourmet  organic  local food that works with kids.   Atmosphere is great with a high ceilinged great room and a big outdoor patio.  Lots of light and a nice warm atmosphere.   It's more comfort food than anything else and the baked goods are exceptional.   It's a bit more expensive than average but well worth it in terms of the quality of ingredients and wonderfully consistent taste.   Service is good no great but most mistakes are driven by being overly busy rather than attitude.   A favorite of ours for family dinners and brunches.,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
0LtFE_pQ9R0rXUknlnFGrw,PqvmHle80aUgydUJf3g6HQ,6,4,9/13/2012,I was looking for a casually classy choice for dinner with the fam in Palo Alto  and Mayfield fit my specifications quite nicely! Lots of other reviews down here seem to be for brunch or lunch  but I found it to be a wonderful vibe at dinner. The lighting was low a  and there was lots of charming outdoor seating as well.   As for the food  I found it quite tasty but just a bit pricier than I would expect for the fanciness level. I had the summer squash pizza ($17)  which was HUGE and featured a delicious crust as well as a nice  spicy kick thanks to the peppers on there. Another favorite was the burrata appetizer. The tomatoes were so fresh and sweet and the burrata so delish that we ordered a second one right away. I also tried a bite of the 'meatball madness' special they had going on  which was $24 for three large-ish meatballs  some angel hair pasta  and a small side Caesar which wasn't really too much to write home about. My mom and husband both ordered the halibut  which they both enjoyed but when I tasted it I felt it was way too dry. The veggies on the side tasted fresh and lovely  though.   The service was friendly and attentive - our waters were constantly being refilled by the nice folks wearing plaid shirts. I have to say  I think it's a funny choice for server attire  but it was unique!  A nice touch came at the end of the meal when they sent the four of us home with two enormous baguettes from their bakery. My parents are huge bread lovers so it definitely ended the meal on a good note.   Again  I'm torn because I did have a wonderful experience and really could taste the quality in their ingredients  but I do think the price points are a bit high for what you get overall. A good once-in-a-while meal but would probably get too pricey to make this my go-to dinner joint.,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0

I have been gluten free for almost a year now and have had no problem cutting out bread until I had bread from the Mayfield Bakery.  I loved this bread so much that I went on a crazy binge and ate almost an entire loaf!

This place is pretty pricey and the predominantly VC/Palo Alto money crowd doesn't mind spending $10 for a bowl of soup (tho  the corn chowder was delicious)  $16 for a small personal pizza  and $7 for a hot tea.  Sitting outdoors in Palo Alto in the Summer for lunch is one of the great pleasures of life and Mayfield makes the experience lovely - so much so that you almost forget about the $13 asparagus salad.  But I will come again  because the service was good (tho maitre d' seemed a bit disorganized) and the food was fresh and tasty and I will make sure to bring an expense account (either mine or someone elses)""",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

The menu changes seasonally I believe...love restaurants that do that.  Sat at the counter and they started us off with complimentary lemon pastries. Nice!  Rotisserie chicken breast salad: looks unappealing but the chicken is really flavorful and moist  Pulled Chicken sandwhich with brie and bacon: the bread was perfectly soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside.

Upon entering the restaurant  I was disappointed by the lack of service.  I asked a member of the staff for tissue paper for my running nose.  They directed me to some harsh paper towels in the bathroom.  This is the type of service I would expect from a truck-stop diner.  There is no reason for a restaurant charging these prices to have this level of service.  The menu is limited.  In fact  there were only three items that sounded tasty.  Looking around at the plates of the other guests  I was not hopeful.  Also  the restaurant was so loud I could not hear my gf across the table.  The decor was bright and shinny  but the mirrored half-wall behind me kept blinding me.  Also  the butcher paper on the table-cloth was very tacky.  There was no shortage of staff.  They seem to have at least 10 cooks in the kitchen and an equal amount of waiters for a tiny restaurant.  But  we had to flag someone down to take our order.  The food on the menu was poorly described.  We ordered gnocchi and got gnudi  we ordered a pulled chicken sandwich and got chicken salad.  They were alright.  But  the leek soup we ordered was not edible.  It was just disgusting and had the texture of watery baby food.  The flavors were dull.  Nothing was prepared properly.  The mushrooms were gummy  the chicken had bits of keel bone in it.  The soup was sour because the broth used as a base was probably rancid.    The only positive was the bread.  It was very tasty and had a delicious crust.  I have had the cakes next door and they are not very good.  I love cake.  I have no desire to eat this cake.  I came in with high hopes.

Our waiter was really cold  and I felt like I had to raise my hands like an over-eager third grade student for like 8-10 minutes every time I needed him for something. Very annoying. Also  brunches = constant coffee refills... despite having a pretty decent house brew  that was not the case here. I almost felt like I was inconveniencing the waiter asking for refills. Then when I was given the bill  they only charged my card for half the amount despite the total on the itemized receipt. When I pointed out the error to the waiter  I received no apologies or thanks for being honest  and got given a second bill as if nothing had gone wrong. I had to ask and double check that the first charge had been voided. Maybe next time I'll just pay the lower charge and get the waiter to pay for the difference out of his own pocket. Yeah  service was that bad.  The food was okay  but for what it was it was very overpriced.

After I gave them 4 stars a couple of weeks ago  I have been here several times.  My husband has come here even more  and we were extremely happy to become repeat customers of this place.  Sure  there were minor faux pas related to the service (they didn't split the blue cheese in the salad from the rest when asked  it took them forever to come and take the order  etc)  but given the ambience and food  I was completely willing to let all those go and allow for them to spend some more time to solve it.  Well  recently  after a nice bike ride  we were really looking forward to stop by at Mayfield for their lovely breakfast pizza.    What we had originally heard was that This restaurant is meant to be open all the way from 9am till closing at night so that customers can come whenever they want"" (We actually heard this from one of the servers working there).  Well  apparently  this does not apply to weekends.  We arrived at 4:30  starving.  The maitre'd was extremely unaccomodating and said ""Technically we are closed from 4 to 5 on weekends.  And  when we open for dinner  we cannot serve you breakfast pizza since our kitchen does not have the capability"".  She said this after asking the manager.  Um  excuse me?  This is not some high-end restaurant that only has a few seatings a day and hence has limited ingredients.  All we asked for was a pizza.  They have another variation of pizza on their dinner menu.  How difficult is it to change the toppings?  And  I really don't understand why they have to close the kitchen for one hour (even weirder since they can operate fine on weekdays) - and  there were people actually being served when we went there (I guess they managed to slip in right before 4pm??).     I don't want to be a difficult customer  but I also don't enjoy unaccomodating service for very confusing reasons.  Other places in Palo Alto serve food throughout the day and they are perfectly fine.  (And that is what the Mayfield staff told me that they do  to begin with.)  And besides  the kind of attitude we got is no way to treat a customer  repeater or not.   It is too bad because the bakery and the food is very nice here.

I suppose when I really thought about the overall food quality and the price  that is where there was a disconnect for me.  Honestly  the food does seem overpriced for the quality or perhaps the preparation.  Now  I am NOT saying that the food is bad.  All I'm saying is that it does not seem priced accordingly or perhaps needs preparation that justifies the high price point?  Also  I think the service is so-so.  Again  I'm NOT saying that the service is bad but simply so-so which doesn't support the high price point.  I am impressed with the restaurant manager and his commitment to improving the customer experience but there is more room for improvement.,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0

First  the prices are high for what you get.  With the abundance of competition in Palo Alto  including a fabulous restaurant right NEXT door  it's hard to understand why Mayfield does not offer more competitive pricing.  Secondly  the food is just not very tasty.  I recall the pancetta pizza in particular -- it tasted really bad.  Third  service is lacking -- waiter did not check up on us and we had to flag down someone to clear our plates and bring us dessert menus.  After dessert menus were given to us  no one came back to take our order for another 20 minutes.  At that point we really just wanted to leave.  Lastly  towards the end of the night they offer complimentary bread to their patrons -- not sure if this is the way they go about getting rid of their breads.  I thought this was a very nice surprise  but found the bread to be SUPER HARD right when I got home.  I mean  seriously  no oven or microwave could have made this bread any softer.  All in all  Mayfield was a disappointment both times.  I would not recommend this restaurant at all.,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0

Twelve hours of fasting for bloodwork (when it turned out I didn't need to) earned me a decadent pastry--at least that's what my low-blood-sugar addled brain told me.  I bypassed Douce France without hesitation and made a beeline for Mayfield. Even though my previous pastry experience hadn't been memorable  I thought I'd try once more. The almond croissant I ordered was one of the best I've ever had. The filling was a little thicker than I prefer  but not at all marzipan-y. But the croissant itself was perfect: tender but very flaky and crisp on the outside. Definitely better than Patisserie Philippe's and possibly better than Tartine's!,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Maybe he thought I would change my mind because it was ""decomposed"".  It's half of a very tasty rotisserie chicken with butter lettuce  blue cheese  avacado  bacon and a farm egg with a light drizzle of vinagrette.  The quality of the ingredients made this Cobb superior to any Cobb salad I've ever had  anywhere.  Just needed some tomatoes  in my opinion.  The kids menu is excellent because it contains the kinds of food that little kids really eat.  My son had the buttered penne pasta  no cheese  and the chicken drumstick from my salad.  That and a warm buttered roll made him the happiest diner in the entire establishment.    I don't usually order dessert at lunch time  but I overheard another guest raving about the carrot cake and that happens to be one of all-time favorite desserts.  We didn't have enough time before we had to pick the big brother up from school  so I thought I would just have to order it next time  but the waiter let me know that I could buy a slice in their bakery next door  so that's exactly what I did.

It had a pretty good crowd at 1:30 pm  about 1/2 full  but the MUSIC was awful  lots of hard rock and screaming.  Most of the crowd were in their 40's to 60's.  It is not a teenage place.  Weirdest music given the type of clientele.  Then we sat down.  Very very noisy to talk to each other.  We had to shout the entire time.  The chairs (ice cream parlor style) are terribly uncomfortable. I opted to then sit on the soft leather bench and let my partner sit on the hard chair. He's a nice guy!  White table cloths with brown butcher paper on the top.  They offered regular or sparkling water ay no extra charge and placed a nice chilled jug of it on the table.  Great idea!  The waiter was very nice and attentive.  The bread they served was hard as a ROCK.  I scratched the roof of my mouth on the hard crust.  Butter was nicely served in a small little dish.  OK so far we've got bread and water.  Menu was very pricey.  I ordered the sweet gem lettuces with deviled eggs salad. Only ONE lettuce came and a buttermilk dressing for $11.00.   It had 5 lettuce leaves of romaine  and one hard boiled egg split in half with deviled egg filling. Fine if you're paying $4.00 but ELEVEN BUCKS for that?  Give me an  Effing break.  A total rip off.  Oh  I forgot ... yes it had croutons on it.  $11.00!!!!!  My friend had the Cobb Salad which came with chopped romaine lettuce  crumbled bleu cheese  bacon bits and 1/3 of a chicken with the bones on it.  The chicken was very good  soft and tenter  but it too was $16.00.  Then we ordered the side dish of flash fried brussel sprouts.  $4.50.  A fair price for those.  Sauteed crispy and pretty darn good.  It was $32.80 and then tip $5.00 made it almost $40.00 for almost nothing.  We were hungry when we left.,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1

It still feels too new  while next door at Calafia  they have their kinks worked out already.  We love the Village Pub - it is the place we love to go to as often as we can for consistently great food and service.  So we were so pleased that Mayfield opened up just a quick hop away.  We went there three times in the last two weeks - once for brunch and twice for dinner.  And I have to say  it was inconsistent.    For brunch  the prices were reasonable  but the portions were small.  However  it was interesting and flavorful and that was what brought us back for dinner.  We were giving them 3.5 stars for brunch.  Dinner #1 was pretty good.  I had the bavette  which was meaty and flavorful and perfectly cooked and seasoned.  My husband's pasta with lamb cheeks looked beautiful  but it was barely warm when it was served.  I guess kitchen timing is still needing some work.  Our waiter was competent and checked in regularly.  Overall  this night was a 3 star night.  Dinner #2 was a few nights later - and it was just ok.  The bread they brought out was dry and a bit overdone.  My hamburger was supposed to be cooked to chef's preference - which was medium-rare  but somehow ended up well well well done.  The kitchen did make it right - for which I am grateful.  But my other dining companion's meals were cooked properly and looked good.  Service tried  but wasn't consistent.  This night was a 1 star night.    We will return - and hopefully to more consistent service and better timed food.

Stopped by today for lunch and ordered their turkey sandwich w/ gruyere cheese (which came with a side of their farm greens"") and a decaf mocha. I love how they served their coffees in a bowl. It reminded me of Rose's Cafe on Union St. in SF (which I totally miss now that I'm down in the peninsula exclusively). The sandwich was delightful with it's delectably toasted bread and enclosed within a meaty portion of sliced turkey and melted gruyere cheese. The side of farm greens was perfectly dressed with a light vinaigrette. I took a gander of the dessert menu and I had to really kick the will power up a notch or two for maximum resistance to the temptation. I've taken yet another mental note to come back another time and try their dessert.

This morning's experience was probably worth 3 stars  so we'll even the two experiences out to 2 stars.   The bakery portion (as opposed to the cafe portion) of the establishment. My ham and gruyere croissant was delicious  and my cousin's brown sugar biscuit looked pretty damn good as well.   I found the staff *still* seriously lacking. After the cashier asked us to repeat our coffee orders three times  she completely forgot that I had ordered coffee and seemed incredibly confused when I asked where my coffee was 5 minutes after my cousin's latte (she ordered a cafe au lait) arrived.   Also  though there are a few cute indoor tables in the bakery portion  the acoustics are so bad that sitting there isn't nearly as pleasant as it should be.

The food tasty enough to justify the high prices  the service was passable  and the atmosphere was great.  However  the past few times I've gone for brunch have been absolutely atrocious.  Once  I ordered a lemon pancake  and had to send it back because the outside was burned and the inside was not cooked at all.   The cook stormed out to our table and said that the pancake was supposed to be like that (I've had that pancake 3 other times before that  and they were NEVER like that.  Plus  any decent cook knows that the reason they turned out that way was because he cooked it on high heat.)  He agreed to recook it and of course it wasn't mushy on the inside.  It took him 25 minutes  though.  Another time  we were seated and had to wait 30 minutes for our water and coffee  and still didn't see our food after 1 hour.  We were so disgruntled  we upped and left.    If this place had consistent food and good service  I'd go back  but it's so inconsistent that I wouldn't recommend it.

0LtFE_pQ9R0rXUknlnFGrw,gsSr-Y-OtYgQrovsDi2v5Q,1,2,2/12/2011,So we have been to Mayfield about four times since it opened and it has progressively gone down hill. Today was the worst.  We got there around 2:30 pm. It took about 10-15 minutes for someone to come over to our table.  The cafe was not that busy. When the waiter came and took our drink order  it was another 10 plus minutes before we saw our drinks. It wasn't like it was busy. I desperately wanted  a chicken salad sandwich but they were out of chicken salad. Really? They specialize in brined chicken and you can order a chicken to take home. They couldn't make some more chicken salad?  Fine. They were out of several other things and the menu is limited.   I have been sick and really wanted soup and a sandwich as I had not eaten  in couple of days. I ordered  garlic and leek soup but they only had a couple of sandwich choices. I told waiter I really wanted a sandwich and he said then order the tuna as that was the only other sandwich. I told him I was allergic. He didn't say anything. My son had ordered off the kids menu and I saw a grilled cheese so I asked if I could order a grilled cheese. He said he would need to check as it was on the kids menu. WHAT?  They were out of everything and had no sandwiches. Its a bakery! I was like forget it. I wanted to walk out. The waiter said okay you want a grilled cheese. I replied yes. I had to beg for a grilled cheese. Lovely.  When the drinks came out  they were fantastic. Kids had sour cherry lemon/lime aide.They loved it.  I ordered a bloody mary and it was the BEST mixed drink I have ever had in my life.  It was incredible.It was a work of art. It is the only reason I gave two stars. When the food finely came  mine was missing. They brought me a cheese pizza. I told them again  I wanted grilled cheese.  Hmm .....maybe the manager rejected my request since I am not under 12. 15 minutes later when the waiter came by  I asked if I could have my soup.  Another 5 minutes it arrived.  It was piping hot so I was thankful for that... It was a solid soup but not worth $9. By this time my family was done and ready to go. Then the grill cheese arrived.  The selection here limited and it is expensive. A family of four  with tip $76 dollars for an omellette  a hamburger  a kids pasta with butter and cheese  a kids grilled cheese  and a bowl of soup  1 order of fries  1 bloody mary 8.50 (worth every penny and I would have paid more ) and two sour cherry lemon/lime aides.  My advice to the management. You need to expand the menu a tad bit and do a little bit better job of planning. A bakery that has one sandwich option of tuna at 2:30 pm on a Saturday? Really? The service today was marginal.  I felt like I was a Dennys. And if I had been  the entire meal would have cost $20.  But I wouldn't have had that amazing bloody mary! The waiter seemed like a nice guy but the coordination and communication of the team was horrible.This is Palo Alto. I will spend the money for great food  but you better bring on the service and if you run out of whats on the menu  get creative and don't give me grief for ordering a grilled cheese.

0LtFE_pQ9R0rXUknlnFGrw,D3RlUOUPck7isSFk2pvIrg,1,2,3/20/2010,It took about 15 minutes for us to be seated in a booth when we arrived on a Friday evening at 8 pm.  It was noisier than we expected since the very dim lighting suggested a more intimate dining experience.  The menu was a little limited  but suitably Palo Altan given the restaurant's penchant for organic foods.  Unfortunately  the descriptions in the menu were unmatched by the quality of the dishes that arrived at our table.  Although the creme fraiche did smooth out the texture of the velvety golden potato leek soup without making it too heavy  its taste was ruined by over-salting.  The braised lamb shoulder came with fingerling potatoes and chantenay carrots.  The lamb could have been cooked for a little longer  as the leaner parts were still quite tough.  The carrots did add some mild sweetness to distract from the blandness from the potatoes.  None of this would have made for a terrible dish  except that everything was swimming in a sea of oil  probably rendered from the lamb fat during braising -- the taste of the actual food was masked by the film of grease around each bite.  The French green lentils and chickpea fries were unoffensive as sides  but not particularly noteworthy either.  The soup and the entree arrived at our table within 3 minutes of ordering.  While the dishes we ordered may have been prepared mostly beforehand  the speed was a little off-putting  to say the least.  It didn't help that our dishes did get cold quickly.  The highlight was the duo of chocolate pot de creme and chocolate fondant cake.  Also  the portion sizes were surprisingly small compared to the average  which meant that they were actually appropriately sized.  Ultimately  the food was mediocre and the price excessive.  The one redeeming factor was that  upon leaving  we were offered a free loaf of bread of our choice from a large selection in several different baskets.  The sandwiches we made the next day with some salmon and cream cheese almost made up for our disappointing dining experience.,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0
0LtFE_pQ9R0rXUknlnFGrw,#NAME?,1,4,2/2/2010,"To quickly sum up the Mayfield Bakery and Cafe:  Serivce: Excellent Food: Excellent Parking: Blah Decor:  Excellent  I highly recommend the Mayfield Burger!  The meat is delicious and it's served on their fresh baked bun with some of their huge onion rings.  Very tasty and enjoyable (which eases the pain of the $13 price tag).  Add some of their great bacon (thick cuts with a nice amount of crunch...not too greasy...more like higher end pork belly or roast pork"") to the burger for some extra flavor.  I recommend sharing your bacon and not ordering more than one of the extra toppings because the burger just doesn't need it.  But who can resist bacon?  Share it with your friends...trust me.  Unfortunately I haven't had any of their other offerings (hey  it's a good burger!) but I hear they are just as appetizing (rotisserie pork sandwich and chicken sandwich are good I'm told).  To accompany these lunch specials I would recommend a cast iron kettle of one of their tasty organic tisanes (aka: herbal teas = teas which don't use actual tea leaves so don't count).  I had the ""African Nectar"" which was quite good!  While waiting for your food...make sure you sample (it's hard to eat a rational amount and not fill up) some of their freshly baked bread.  Their bread has a great tank armor-like crust which I look for.  Great crunch with delicious bread innards.  =)  Good food is luckily accompanied by a great (attentive  polite and cheerful) waitstaff and nice decor (mirrors next to your head in the booths are a bit distracting...who wants to see themselves as they gorge on a huge burger?) but do help when spying on pretty ladies (if you're into that!)""",1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0

As we walked in  I'd already seen some familiar faces. One of the floor managers from Spruce  Chef Gordon Drysdale  and I think Tim Stannard and Brannin Beal were at the bar.   The space is very long and hidden in the facade of the aging Town & Country center  they've done a nice job in giving a modern sleek look to the interior. There's also a large patio area that will come in handy when the weather warms up again. The servers are dressed more casually here like Antica but the food is more towards  Spruce/Village Pub. It's kind of an interesting dichotomy of casual and elegant. Small plates  pizza  soups  and contemporary entrees are augmented by fun things like house made sodas and shakes. They'll serve lunch and brunch in the upcoming days and of course they'll be the bakery that will be supplying their other restaurants.  After getting our beverages and complimentary house made sparkling water we got:  - Beet salad with fennel and dill dressing - Artichoke and potato soup - Braised pork shoulder with bacon and brussel sprouts - Lamb cheeks with house made papparadelle - Meyer lemon cheesecake with blood orange - Boston Cooler shake  The salad was ok but the soup was quite tasty for the starters. The pork shoulder and lamb cheeks were very good but the lamb portion was on the small side  though the papparadelle made me almost forget that. To finish both desserts were tasty and the shakes were kind of a fun way to round out the night. Good promise to the food and \ are definitely points for my return.  The service was friendly but a bit nervous. Spruce had a much smoother debut and even though they've been training for three weeks  you could tell the staff here was on high alert.

We got there around 12:30pm and got a table immediately. The waitress came and serve us water and bread while we were trying to decide on what to order. I ordered the Cobb salad and my friend ordered the Brioche (french toast with fresh strawberries and fatty pork.) The Cobb salad is delicious and light  and consists of half rotisserie chicken with  butter lettuce  eggs  bacon and avocado. The chicken is roasted to perfection with the skin being crispy and the meat being very tender and flavorful. The Brioche is very tasty too with fresh strawberries and fatty pork and is surprisingly not heavy at all.   Last but not least  we ordered the carrot cake  for dessert and the chef totally ruined it for us by making it too sweet. 5 stars for presention with buttermilk cream  sprinkles and caramel beautifully decorated around the carrot cake. After the first bite  the only thing that came to our mind was that it was TOO sweet.

The tea arrived in this really cool iron teapot - and it was absolutely delicious! I had enough tea for at least 4 full cupfuls - definitely enough to warm me up on a cool winter day.  The food was another story - hmmm. The lunch entrees arrived quickly. My friend looked at her salad and asked So where's the crab?"" She had to move the green around a bit and found some dollops of crab salad beneath the greens. Not exactly what she had expected.  My hamburger was cooked more on the rare side than medium. It was plain  but on the side was some mayonnaise  pickles on a leaf of butter lettuce and three large onion rings. The bun was fresh - not your standard sesame seed bun. The onion rings were hot and crunchy.  We declined on sharing any dessert - but maybe I'll have to return just to check out their bakery.

As others have mentioned  the sticky sweet aroma that this place pumps out saturates the air on Telegraph between Dwight and Haste so much that actually taking a bite of the pastries themselves seems an optional part of the experience.   But now that I have finally been inside the lair and tasted their GOODNESS  let me tell you  it is NOT optional.  Yes  they have a few more calories than the smell  but oh are they delicious calories.   I have not tried everything here (thank god)  but after a couple of visits  I covered my absolute favorites: a maple bar  an apple fritter and an oatmeal cookie.  The maple bar was OK.  Very sweet  but a little too soft and doughy.  The icing seemed to be too heavy for the doughnut.  Very indulgent  delicious maple flavor  but very  very messy.  The oatmeal cookie was above-average  well-spiced with a hint of nutmeg and enough cinnamon and it had a good balance of chewy and crispy.    What really knocked my socks off  however  was the apple fritter.  OH MY GOD.  WHO KNEW that something so HEAVENLY could exist?!?!  It was super sweet like I like 'em  mostly from the outer glaze coating of crispy sugar.  Inside the dough is fluffy and soft and moist and filled with perfectly-sized chunks of apple.  The contrast between the crunch outside and the soft inside is to die for.  Literally.  This thing is gigantic and probably has more fat and sugar than should be consumed in one sitting... although consuming such delicious macro nutrients in huge quantities every now and then is probably one of life's greatest pleasures  right??  I know I'm not alone here!

If I come back next time I'm definitely trying out more of their toasted sandwiches. He also upgraded his free chips to the dirty chips for $0.75 which wasn't too bad.  Overall  it was a good experience at Sandbag's  I was so full by the time I got out (I didn't eat any lunch so I was starving)  the ingredients they use was fresh  I'll probably make another stop sometime to try the other sandwiches.""",1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0

I got delivery order  the Navajo Chicken sandwich  whihc is Sliced chicken breast on grilled sourdough with avocado bacon  tarragon and mayo.   Sounds good... and it was  but...  it was just too heavy.  There was simply too much mayo  so even though the sandwich itself wasn't huge  but the time I finished half of it I was feeling very full.  And not the good full you get after eating fruit and vegetables; it was the other kind of full  the kind of full that makes you regret whatever you just ate.   But I don't want to seem that harsh.  Maybe it was just the wrong sandwich  maybe I should have asked for them to go light on the mayo.,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

Please read! It's very important especially if you're a Bruin.   This was sent to me via Facebook from a fellow bruin!!!  If you didn't already know  I work for the Daily Bruin as a sales rep. It's my job to go out and sell clients advertising space in the paper and around campus. As part of my duties  I am sometimes required to meet with clients  as a personal touch. Today  I journeyed into Westwood and met with Eric  the 27 year old owner of Sandbag's  the sandwich place on Westwood Blvd.   When I met with him I noticed Eric looked tired  the type of tired you get when you've given up everything you have for the sake of survival and it's not enough.  This is what happened to Eric:  Sandbag's primary customers are the businessmen and women of Wilshires' skyscrapers. As the economy crashed  those businesses were forced to start laying off employees. Eric  who has over the last four years built up relationships with return clients  started losing familiar faces. Not only did he lose their habitual income  he lost contacts to office events that he used to cater.   As the deficit got larger Eric started falling behind on rent payments. To save Sandbag's he started putting his own money into the restaurant. He moved out of his house into his sister's condo. As the deficit got larger he started finding roommates  students that go to UCLA. Eric now shares a room with three undergrad students he met at the store.   The saddest thing about Eric is that given his position  he should be angry  bitter and spiteful. But he's not. Eric is always smiling  always putting on a good face. Cause everyone is experiencing the same story  they all have different ways of handling it. I find that putting a smile on is the only thing that keeps me sane. ""   A meal at Sandbag's costs less than $8 (that includes tax). Despite his position  he gives students a bag of chips  a cookie and drinks for free. To meet the rent Eric needs $4000  which is equivalent to 500 students ordering any of his delicious sandwiches. Which is = to 125 students a week for four weeks.   It is my belief that as a student body  we are more than open to saving lives. Last year we raised over a third of a million dollars during Dance Marathon and over 100 000 at Relay for Life  Mighty Mic's yearly concert-for-a-cause  and 24 Hour Musical; all in support of those who are in incredible need. A walk down Bruinwalk any given day presents you with hundreds of opportunities to promote the cause of your choice.   If we all spend less than $30/month at Sandbag's we'll not only be preserving a trademark of the Village (before Eric  owners have held onto the place for the last 20 years) we'll be giving Eric a fighting chance at finding those sorely missed catering jobs that were the bulwark of his income.   We'd be doing something that gives back to a cause we can see  feel and taste. What's more is that for that $30 we're not donating to a website  we're getting fed!  Eric has always been a staunch supporter of UCLA  he only purchased advertising with me last time because of the contribution to the paper and it's meaning to the school. Before I met him through the Daily Bruin  I went in asking if I could put up a poster for a HOOLIGAN Theatre Company play  he was one of four businesses that said sure no problem. As I was putting it up  I saw posters for hip hop groups amidst other UCLA student sponsored events on his wall.   If you're in  we need to act fast  Eric is meeting with his landlord at the end of this month  and hopefully we'll be able to do enough to save him and to save Sandbag's.   We're trying to get as many students over there this month as we can. Join us every Saturday starting this one  and let's bring Sandbag's back from the brink. If we can get a HUGE group that meets there every Saturday and individuals coming throughout the week  maybe we can give Eric a shot.   *** I've been eating at sandbags because of this haha! but in all honestly  I genuinely do love my Navajo chicken sandwich!! ^__^""",0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0

I don't work in that area  but any time I come through  I make it a point to stop by.  And all of you that have been to Westwood know  you don't stop by Westwood for lunch unless you're already in there.  But I go through the shuffle to find some parking because this place is worth it.  First time I went  didn't know what to order  asked the guy at the cashier  he recommends a Navajo Chicken.  LOVED IT.  Full of flavor  lots of fresh veggies.  Not only that  I found out the guy behind the register is the owner.  Man  he was friendly and helpful.  Really adds that nice touch when you're at lunch.  Since then  I've been ordering the Veggie  sometimes I ask for a little Roast Beef in it.  I know I know  a Veggie sandwich for lunch?? But let me tell you  all the fresh ingredients  literally stuffed inside  makes for a very filling meal.  I haven't had a sandwich that I didn't like and I haven't had a an experience that wasn't great.  And come on  there's people complaining about price?? Don't compare Subway to this kind of quality.  That's like saying Father's Office is an expensive burger compared to Mcdonald's.

If my review were based on the New Yorker itself I would've given a 4 star review  but I've knocked down points for the following:  1) Hours: This place closes way too early for a college town  and sometimes unexpectedly closes even before the posted hours (happened to me twice already).  2) Location: It's in the worst part of Westwood that's always busy  has traffic  far away from any decent parking spots and in that corner that ALWAYS smells for some reason.  3) Sides: Yes they're made fresh but that doesn't make up for the fact that they don't taste very good  and I've had 4 of them so far to back up my point (this includes the free cookies with every sandwich  it was nice to have them at first until you take your first unimpressed bite).  4) Hot sandwiches: They stop serving them 30 minutes before closing  which I'm sure is what most people come to eat.

I must say that i was impressed that they didn't charge extra for cheese or avocado ($6.95).  I ended up getting mustard  grilled onions  and avocado on multi grain.  Unfortunatly the mustard was very overpowering and all I could really taste was mustard.  After scraping off some of the mustard it tasted much better.  But the pastrami does not stand up to Rhineland Deli in Thousand Oaks.    I also had a bite of the steak fajita wrap.  That's got a little kick with the chipotle mayo.  Overall  not bad  but not the best.  I probably would have given it another star if i was a UCLA student since that means a free drink and chips.,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0

Still swooning from the bacon in my cobb salad from my last visit  I made sure that the sandwich I ordered included some porky goodness. I opted for the Incredible Sandbag's because  hey  if it has the establishment's name on it  it's got to be good.   It really was good! I'm usually a pull the sandwich apart and take a slice of bread off type  but the sandwich was put together so well that I decided  screw it  I'll eat the whole sandwich altogether.   However  I did make one adjustment- I pulled some bacon out to eat as my last bite. The bacon was  again  AWESOME. Seriously  can I buy a bag of just bacon? That would enable me to venture into the non-bacon bearing sandwiches. If I haven't said it enough  the bacon is  as my good friend says  amazeballs.""  The only thing I'm kicking myself about is that I completely forgot about the UCLA/UCLA Extension/Kaplan staff special that gives free chips (or salad) and a drink.

Not that it matters to me  because I usually get my crack....I mean donuts to go  but this is the most hip donut joint I've ever seen. Probably due to it's proximity to Cal Poly.

The first thing you notice when you get to SLO Donut Co is its atmosphere. It has a modernist/industrial look (concrete floors  old wooden paneling  etc.) The space is nice  lots of natural lighting during the day so you don't have to worry about glaring fluorescent lights. It seems like a pretty awesome place to study as well. There is free wifi  good coffee  and it is open 24-hours; key ingredients for a great study environment.   Speaking of the coffee  they get theirs from Joebella. They are a local fair trade coffee roaster from Atascadero. The coffee I had was pretty good  definitely much better than what you would normally find at the average donut shop. I didn't try any of their specialty drinks  but it seemed like their baristas weren't very experienced. Understandable since the place opened today. I can't judge though  since I didn't try one.  But how are the donuts? I had a glazed buttermilk and a regular chocolate  while my girlfriend tried the maple old fashioned. They weren't mega mind blowing  but all three were fresh and tasty.   Overall  if you're having a huge donut craving  I would still recommend Sunshine Donuts.

All donuts are made equally right? I thought so until I tried this place. These donuts are super light and fluffy  with amazing dough. The glazes  yes all of them  are extremely tasty and have just the right amount of sweetness. One of the best things about this place is the sheer diversity of donuts - they have your usual maple and glaze and chocolate highlights (old fashioned  bars  twists  french  etc)  but then they have their outrageous donuts - the avocado cream cheese  the peanut butter and jelly  the MAPLE AND BACON OMG I DIED ITS SO GOOD  the raspberry  orange  java maple the cereal donuts   mint  devils food cake  etc. I know a lot of the donuts have been done before ( voodoo donuts up in portland for one)  but slodoco just does it better. The service is always great too - friendly staff and owners  always willing and eager to talk or make recommendations. The atmosphere is great for this town too  since they have free wifi  coffee  ample drinks  other foods - muffins and such  the decorations are unique and they always have local art hanging on the walls. But wait  there's more. They have contests almost nightly to win free donuts for people in the store  they have live music/open mic nights  they really cater to this city  especially the always hungry student population. Plus  they are open 24 hours - what more can you ask for? Quite possibly the best donut store in the world.   *only only only thing that is bad - the seating is uncomfortable if you are trying to study there for more than 3 hours - all wood = all sore.,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0

Decided to come here during finals week with a friend at around 11 at night and it was pretty packed. All the seats were taken up and people were just hitting the books.   Prices are around the same as other places  but maybe a few cents higher than places I've been to in SF. Nothing can take my heart away from Bob's Donuts  but this is a good substitute for my terrible donut cravings.   I was anxiously waiting to try their apple fritters after hearing good things about it but to my disappointment they were out of it. Instead  my disappointment was turned around after I asked what that big bar covered with powdered sugar was  and he told me it was a peanut butter and jelly filled donut. I had to get it. Very messy to eat. Powder just goes all over but you can get a nice layer of the sweet pb&j. The donut even has a bit of a crunch. Quite delicious  but not for people in fear of diabetes.   I'm liking this new place and like it even more since it's closer than sunshine. It has a modern atmosphere to it.

I should've asked them to make the quesadillas without cilantro (i'm allergic  sort of)  but the veggie quesadilla was sooooo good that I shovelled 3 wedges of it in before i had to give up (due to the overwhelming taste of the cilantro). if i'm inclined to eat that much cilantro  you know it's for a good reason XD  the food is cheap  and location is convenient. we can walk/tram or cruiser  and get back to our apartments just as easily. the wait isn't too long  unless the entire drumline's there with the munchies :)  i can't make many recommendations  as i'm pescatarian  but i'm a sucker for a good veggie or cheese quesadilla  and these are at the top of the list (next to La Taquiza). it's food places like Tacos Perez that make me want to eat mexican food more often.,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1

Pros: Make your own salad for about $8  HUGE  very fresh with deliciously amazing options.  I got tarragon chicken which was flavorful  delicious and not the least bit dry or gummy like chicken usually is on salad. with basil  artichole  grilled portabellos  and all sorts of yummy ingredients offered and I requested it with balsamic and just a touch of olive oil and y'know what?  It was perfect.  PERFECT.  And y'all know how I feel about perfect salads.  My friend's food looked nummy too.  It was below my friend's office so we came here for a quick bite before doing the Pasadena ArtNight thing  and she said the food is all very good.  The desserts looked delicious...oddly a lot of options with bananas.  Banana tarts.  Banana in brioche.  I don't see a lot of banana pastry like that.  But I like banana.  So good for them.   Soups looked tasty too  and there are good soup/sandwich salad/sandwich combos.  Lots of pretty cupcakes.  So cons: RIDICULOUSLY bad service.  who knew service could be this bad in a place with ONLY us as the customers?  I can't imagine what it turns into during the lunch rush.  Good lord.  My friend J's food came out first...but not the salad he got with it.  Then his wife's food came out.  Then  a few minutes later  his cesar salad.   The coffee they gave him at the counter was cold.  Huh?    I asked them about my salad.  I got an impatient It's being assembled.""  Ok...but could you maybe bring it all out together?  Because otherwise you're just being rude.  The salad arrived  quite tardy but  as mentioned  lovely and delicious  but not with the promised side of bread.  The bread  which is supposedly their ""thing"" was...unimpressive.  I got ciabatta but it was really just a plain white roll...a little grainy on top.  I guess it was dusted with cornmeal.  Ok.  And?  When I asked ""What's the best bread  do you think?"" I expect the staff to have an opinion.  ""Everyone loves the olive"" or ""I really like the rosemary""  or even ""What do you like?  Multi-grain?  Yeah  you should try the granary cobb then!""  Something.  If I go into a shop I expect the salespeople to know their product and have the ability to  I dunno  sell me something I'll like so I can come back satisfied.  But I got ""Um  well  we  have olive  and rosemary  and ciabatta  and..."" as the comatose teenager continued rattling off the same list of breads I saw posted behind her I just gave up and opted for ciabatta.  She seemed relieved.  She nearly put it in my hand until something in her feeble brain woke up and thought ""No  she'd probably like that on a plate since it's all covered in flour.""  Good girl.  Also if you're serving basil please make sure it is 1) Not bruised and 2) Not being served with those little florets at the top of the stalk that are bitter and not supposed to be served.  Make an effort.  Trim the leaves from the stalk.  So the salad was awesome.  My friend's food was awesome except for the fruit cup which my friend said was ""weird tasting.""

The place is cozy  modern and the staff is efficient and hip looking.   My favorite bread in Wheatberry is their chocolate cherry bread. La Brea bakery used to make this and Wheatberry makes a similar version seasonally.  My favorite pastry here is their croissant! It's so rich  flaky and delicious!

When are we ever going to get an Urth Caffe?    Anyhow  service is overall poor.  The employees are usually disinterested and slow.  But like I said  I kept coming back because there aren't many cafes in the area and the food is somewhat good.  However I am now considering never going back because of their HORRENDOUS CUPCAKES.  I do not know how they could have the nerve to sell their vanilla cupcake.  The frosting is completely inedible and the cake was hard and dry.

The Vitamin Water is close to $3  their breakfast burrito is almost $7  the cupcakes are over $3... you catch my drift.   So here's the main reason why I'm not too sure: the servings though perfect  are really SMALL considering the $ you shell out. I woudln't mind paying the extra $ if I felt there was true value in the meal -  but you definitely will not see that here. The service is pretty much non-existent (though  you will catch a table of the 'workers' smoking happily in front of the store).

Original Review:  bastards.  my coworker and i used to go here when it first opened.  this was before i discovered a waaayyyy better bakery  aka Europane.  anyhoo  what drew us to this place was probably the best deal in town:  nice big  dish of soup du jour  and 2 slices of freshly baked bread of choice for $2.37.  you can't beat that.  we went every day.  and it was decently good soup  ie. chicken tortilla  lentil  veggie  etc.  then business started booming and they remodeled the place and all of a sudden no two dollah soup for you!  they tried to replace the soup deal with some soup/salad  and soup/sandwich deals that cost twice as much.    wat. evers.  i hate places that start off cheap and good and wind up overpricing their goods as soon as it starts drawing a crowd.  business is business"" - bullpoop!  you can still run a great business offering great food with decent/cheap prices - just look at Porto's.  other than my review  if you still want to go to this place  here are some recommendations.  i dunno why i'm doing this  but here goes:  raspberry bear claw  and blueberry chiffon cake. and most of the sandwiches are pretty good except the goat cheese and apple thingie.  *****************Cupcake*Update 2/02/08*******************  Came here recently cuz I heard they started making cupcakes to stay afloat with competition on the trend. The entire right casing was dedicated to cupcakes and they had multiple varieties of the same thing. Simple  ie. vanilla/vanilla  chocolate/chocolate - but all decorated differently. They're all smaller in size compared to the cupcake specialty shops. I got a chocolate/chocolate with red velvet.  Their red velvet was the first cupcake that resembled its name. The cake itself was a very bright red color  and its crumbs were used to sprinkle on top to depict a ""red velvet"" appearance. I thought it was kewl... until I tried to bite down on it and the crumbs went EVERY WHERE and made a complete mess. Ugh. -_-  But the red velvet was good. Moist and yum. Despite the bright  red  scariness of the color. It was so good that I didn't really care for the chocolate. I bit into the chocolate and it paled in comparison. I threw the rest away.

They have tried to adapt the menu to fit A\mericans like you and me  and I think that they had done a good job.  I went one time for lunch and enjoyed the sandwich I ordered.  It's not a fast-food restaurant where the food comes out incredible fast.  However  I will say that compared to somewhere like The Corner Bakery the food is healthier and less greasy.  My next dining venture was for breakfast.  My breakfast sandwich was absolutely to die for.  There were sandwich meats  avocado  and little grease.  I haven't had the desserts  but they definitely have left me wondering.  The red velvet cupcakes and the different fruit tarts look scrumptious.

It can be really messy  but it's delicious.  - eggwich with cheese: These are good  but the eggs are very plain.

I'm a big fan of Cafe Rio next door--actually  Cafe Rio used to occupy Bagel Street Cafe's current space--and just coming here felt like a betrayal.

I must give credit where credit is due  but this place also feels like a downtown-financial-district-of-a-huge-American-city hole in the wall  but Downtown Berkeley is not Downtown Houston  or even Downtown San Francisco.  A place here needs character  not an assembly-line mentality.  I'm not talking about friendliness.  The bagels and bagel sandwiches may be more expensive at Cafe Rio; but would you rather spend more money or chip away  however slightly  at your soul?  The choice is yours.,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1

They have many varieties of bagels and more excitingly  a huge variety of cream cheeses. Their bagels are on the softer side which I like  they are easier to eat. I usually get the pesto bagel with the sun dried tomato cream cheese  which is off the charts good. The honey almond cream cheese is also really yummy - the nuts add a great crunch! Their cream cheeses are light  so you don't feel fat and gross after devouring your bagel.  Be wise and cautious with your bagel and cream cheese pairing though  since some pairings are just awfully wrong like almond honey cream cheese with the sourdough bagel. Coming earlier in the day is also a better option  since the popular bagels run out soon. I still haven't tried the bagel sandwiches  but they seem very promising!

The plastic cups are reused without washing.    While making my sandwich  the employee dropped half of the bagel on the floor.  Instead of simply using a new bagel  she picked up the bagel  put it back on the sandwich and handed it to me.  When I asked if she picked it up off the floor  she turned away.

I reaaaaaally wanna try a chocolate chip one.  They also have eggwiches -- bagels with eggs  and other things if you want them (such as bacon and sausage  mmm).  I ended up getting the pizza bagel (when pizza's on a bagel  you can have pizza anytime!  I'm not the only one that gets that stuck in my head anytime I hear pizza bagel  right?).  Takes about 5 minutes to toast it with the cheese melted  but it's pretty yummy  pretty cheap (with pepperoni  $3.79)  and the service is pretty friendly!  All in all  pretty good!

11pH-tGFM7Wbli31mKjRMQ,8x2mQiBa-XiBx8IqET9iQQ,1,2,8/14/2010,Finding truly good authentic bagels can be difficult but Bagel St. Cafe is a poor choice nonetheless (Marin Bagels are far superior  maybe the best in the area  and can be purchased everyday at Berkeley Bowl and Monterey Market).  This review is for the bagels themselves and not for any bagel sandwich or the convenience and ease of a quick snack or meal for nearby students.  Bagel St. Cafe bagels are light and airy with very little flavor and none of the dense  chewy goodness of a true boiled/baked bagel.  They are not bad to eat - any fresh breadlike substance is satisfying on some level - but are a bit expensive  poor defrosted-before-baked(?) quality and should be avoided unless no better options are available.  Lastly  and not trivial  their ValPak advertising coupon received in the mail shows five offers for discount.  Like similar coupons from other businesses all the offers are valid.  Only one of the offers on the coupon is usable per customer.  Instead of tearing off the one offer you'd like to use and save the others for another time  the employee asked for the entire coupon to be forfeited.  The coupon makes no mention  and is a petty policy  to show five offers but to only allow one.  Not one per visit but one total.  Again  Marin Bagels sold at Berkeley Bowl  Monterey Market and perhaps elsewhere are solid  quality bagels at 69 cents a piece and far  far better than Bagel St. Cafe.,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1

The fries were a disappointment  I love Belgian fries and I really don't think these qualify.    I really don't like the decor  the entire space is tiled so sound just echo's loudly and you have to shout to be heard.

Anyway  cute green decor with dark wood benches and tables. Friendly guys behind the counter instructing bewildered customers on the magic of falafel and the salad bar.  #1 Regular Combo ($8.20) comes with falafel in pita with hummus & eggplant (extras for a la carte sando) Belgian fries and drink. Sweet potato fries are +$0.50 which I did. Apparently the $10 Groupon didn't cover tax so I fished out $0.75 or so and grabbed my drink.  They have canned drinks  some fresh juice options (+$1 w/ combo. can't remember a la carte price)  and some pre-made iced teas  lemonade  and Arnold Palmers (1/2 & 1/2 iced tea + lemonade) in plastic pint cups which is what I ended up grabbing. It was watery and bland. I wondered if they were made with ice which had melted to dilute the cup.  The falafel pita comes pretty packed  especially if you get the combo with hummus & eggplant provided. I only had room for a smattering of Israeli salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/17PRKve78GgzlHYdEbK7TQ?select=GUbprjapNFsznPkYMUkAKA) before it looked like things were going to spill onto the salad bar & floor. I did go back a few more times being careful not to touch the utensils to my already partially eaten food.   I can see where people's concerns about sanitation are coming from  though I was the only one I saw go for a refill in the half-hour I was there (8-9 other diners).  The sandwich was OK. The falafels were tasty  but dry. The pita held up well through the whole meal. Toppings were mixed. I liked the tahini  but the garlic sauce was weak. The tabouli was unique and refreshing with no tomatoes and heavy on the mint  but the previously mentioned Israeli salad was very coarsely chopped and a little awkward; too easily slipping off the sandwich onto the table while trying to take a bite.

First off  I'm really a big supporter of the idea of vegetarian fast food and I look forward to the day (which I know will never come) when these veggie fast foods would totally replace all the Burger Kings and McDonalds and KFCs that dotted the American landscape and that of the world. But  Maoz  the rapidly expanding fast food chain with a vision of spreading the vegetarian lifestyle worldwide"" - you have disappointed me time and again  and I just have to voice out my concerns here.  Look  I am not the first person here who says that your falafels are way too dry. Neither am I the first person who raises the sanitation concerns. I am definitely not the first who says that the price is a total rip-off ($8.20 before tax  or $9 after  for a typical Maoz Meal). I guess I will continue to repeat what others have already said  and hopefully we will be heard  somehow  some day.  Like me  perhaps you've been gravitated towards Maoz because you thought it's a vegetarian place and therefore healthy. Dead wrong! For this is certainly NOT a healthy place to grab a bite. The fries taste like frozen fries. The lemonade  ice tea  and lemonade ice tea - all 3 of them - taste like artificially sweetened ice water. The ""unlimited"" salad bar looks lame. And  okay  I'm a Germaphobe  I think the salad bar looks germ-infested  messy and gross. Their signature sandwich - the Maoz Falafel Sandwich - is steeped in rich and thick layers of dripping cream  mayonnaise and garlic sauce  which of course make it tasty for some folks  but it's a far cry from what a ""healthy"" sandwich should taste like.   So you might say  okay  I'll just tell them I'll have it without any sauces or mayonnaise. Yup  that might work  except that that would make the falafels extremely hard to bite into and swallow. Did I mention that they're DRY? Dry they are. Dry. Dry. Very dry. Definitely not the best falafels in town.   Finally  the interior. The interior of Maoz is neither aesthetically pleasing nor particularly clean. There's no design or d\u00e9cor to speak of. Despite the supposedly cheerful color of apple green on its walls  it looks dingy  claustrophobic  and rather depressing. And I think the staff should sweep the floor sometimes.   Any redeemable points? Well  the portion is big and filling  and the guy at the counter is really nice and friendly. That's about it. I feel bad for being so critical of them  considering so many others are worshipping them and so kindly giving them 5 big stars. But to me  really  this is not the best veggie place for starving students and starving folks in general  and it's in no way comparable to Amanda's Feel Good Fresh Food (fast food/burger) and Green Papaya (Thai veggie)  which are just down the road. Please  Maoz! With that hype that you've created  and that grand  brilliant vision of yours which I fully support - you gotta do better than that!  UPDATE: Maoz does have an yelp account! :) Just realized that I got a polite and formal note from them some days ago promising a better and improved version of falafel. Awesome! We shall see! Customers  after all  vote with their dollars. I definitely won't hesitate to write a glowing review if the food turns out healthy and nutritious and taste divine!""",1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1

I used to eat here at least once a week  but one experience really just ruined it for me.  It was a C-C-C-C-ombo of pettiness exhibited by the staff that killed it for me.  Hell  I thought I was super Asian  but that's because I'm broke as hell.  Maoz is a international corporation/franchise that should not feel the need to make the customer feel uncomfortable due to profit margins.  Here's how one visit for me completely shot everything to hell in Titanic-Meets-Iceberg proportions.  Upon entering this fine establishment  my gf busts out a Groupon coupon good for $10.  I immediately notice distaste in the eye's of the cashier/manager who looks like Mike Rowe from Dirty Jobs.  This was further amplified when my gf and I ordered only sandwiches  no fries or drinks (OH NOES THEY'RE ORDERING THINGS WITH THE LOWEST MARKUP!!! WHY NOT BUY OUR $3 SQUEEZED JUICE?).  Oddly  the bill came out to something above $11  which was wierd since both a Maoz & Jr. Maoz should be 10 something with tax.  I take out my credit card to pay the remaining difference of the Groupon.  Literally  I could hear the gears whirring in this guy's head going over profit margins and marginal costs of food production because he requests that I pay with cash because (and I'm paraphrasing as best as memory serves) Groupon was really cutting into their profits and we don't want to lose more to merchant teller fees"".  ...Seriously?  Way to hate on the firms giving you more business.  Maybe you shouldn't use CampusCred  Groupon  and LivingSocial if they cut into your precious profits?  Whatever.  So I fish out a 20 and struggle with my OCD as he breaks such a perfectly nice bill.  Now as starving students  you know we all love Maoz because of the unlimited salad toppings.  It's like a $5 buffet of goodness.  It's advertised on the website  on the front  and on the menu in nice bold letters ""UNLIMITED SALAD TOPPINGS!""  SHIT SON IT HAS AN EXCLAMATION MARK!!! IT MUST BE LEGIT!!! OMG!!!!1111!!!  But no.  As I'm going up to refill my sandwich  I am told that I should eat it like a ""proper sandwich"".  ORLY HOW DOES ONE EAT A SAMMICH PROPERLY?  Should I cut it with a fork and knife  all the while dabbing my mouth with a handkerchief and chortling as my monocle falls out into my glass of water? DAMN IT I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONOCLE PASTE.  I spent the rest of my meal quite uncomfortable  discouraged from going up to the salad bar as I did not wish to be reprimanded for adding toppings  despite the advertising that specified otherwise.  I don't mind paying more for the food at Maoz  it does deserve a higher price imo.  Just don't be so petty to your customers.  Don't bitch to me about Groupon  merchant teller fees  and then have the audacity to tell me how to eat the meal that I paid for.  If Hometown Buffet can offer a lunch of unlimited meat for $8  I'm pretty sure Maoz can offer a bunch of soil-grown vegetables for $5.  Or maybe just don't make toppings unlimited  it's better than awkwardly instructing your customers on the proper eating etiquette applicable only to Maoz's.  I give two stars for the memories  since I won't be coming back.  TL;DR:  I was told how to properly eat a sammich and my monocle dropped from my eye due to shock.""",0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1

We got the maoz pita (pita bread with 4 small falafels) with the endless salad bar. But so much for all you can eat;"" the pita bread was barely big enough to fit more than a few toppings AND they didn't give us a bowl or plate or anything that would help us hold the pita together other than a flimsy pita holder. Plus  the sauces in the squeeze bottles were barely full  and I definitely had to struggle more than I would've liked. It's probably to make sure that we don't take more than ""all you can eat""...??!!?!?!   I'd say false advertising. I couldn't visit the station more than 2 times though I wanted the ""all I can eat"" experience; it just got too difficult to manage it all. Yet  the toppings are still really good so I can't really strip this place of all its dignity and worth.  So  about the cleanliness.  This is purely based on my own observation. As people were grabbing toppings to put into their pita pockets  I saw how the spoons and other utensils at the salad bar they used were touching their food  covered in their germs  most likely. Those very same utensils went back into the communal bowl  where an unknowing victim would pick up the germ-filled utensil to put some food into their pita. At other all-you-can-eat  they highly discourage using even the same plate.  Yet  no one would've known the dangerous exchange of germs occurring before one's very eyes if it weren't for the modern  minimalist decor.

I usually always come here just to get their falafels+toppings because they're fresh and flavored well but this time I decided to get the Junior Maoz deal that comes with a drink and fries and I'm never going back to getting just falafels again (although I wouldn't mind just a falafel sandwich if I wasn't too hungry).  The cashier recommended getting a mix of the two fries because I had asked which he preferred. The two together are soooo so good. Not only are the fries nicely crispy on the outside  they're not too salty/oily. The sweet potato fries are surprisingly sweet (in a good way  of course) and the belgium fries have a great texture and perfect amount of saltiness and crunchy goodness.  TRY THEM!  Minus a star because my falafel took longer than usual to take and their pickup system is a little flawed because they don't give you a receipt with your number on it.

The cashiers seemed to think so because immediately after they tried to figure out a better way to call out people's orders.,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1

I always get #1 which is the regular falafel sandwich with eggplant  fries  and a canned drink. I substitute sweet potato fries for a fee over regular fries though  so much better! This time it wasn't over-fried. Get the garlic sauce with the fries and it'll be heaven. I think I was clueless last time and ordered an orange juice because I didn't realize my meal came with a drink. Don't forget  unless you want to pass on the carbonated drinks. Hansens mandarin lime is my favorite. I didn't know Canada Dry used high fructose corn syrup...sucks.   My friend opted for the whole wheat pita but I stuck with the white pita bread. The sandwich is actually really fulfilling because of the unlimited salad bar"". It took me forever to get halfway because I kept adding the grilled broccoli and cauliflower because it's so tasty. Garlic sauce is also a must! At the bottom  I had 3-4 falafels which were delicious. It can definitely get messy with many sauces and salsas. If you like to get creative  stick some sweet potato fries into your sandwich for some sweet flavor.  I noticed that there is also another promotion going on with the Punchd app. I just have to scan the QR code provided by the cashier for every purchase and I would get a free sandwich after the 10th.   Also  if you check-in on the Yelp app just once  you unlock the $5 sandwich and drink deal  so easy! But wait  don't forget foursquare. 5 check-ins is a free drink so you don't even have to get a meal!  I really hope more customers come to Maoz because I would hate to see them go. There's so much social media marketing but word-of-mouth needs to flow better. They can't survive issuing daily deals all the time  so go to Maoz for lunch  dinner  or late night since they close at 10pm Sunday-Thursday and 11pm Friday-Saturday (if I remember correctly).""",0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1

I can only tell you we take many measures to constantly insure proper-sanitation and handling of our food   for example  salad tongs are changed and sanitized frequently in order go above and beyond requirements."" So I went back to Maoz a few nights ago. Asked the guy who was working there if he ever sees ppl doing that and he's like  ""Yeah unfortunately"" but didn't say whether or not he corrects them.

Don't be turned away by the fact that it's a vegetarian restaurant. You really would not even notice you weren't eating meat.

In fact  what I had done was eaten most of the fillings inside my pita pocket  without eating the actual bread.  This allows me to stuff more veggies and sauces into it.

Mine was Yankee stadium circa 1990. The visiting team won but the falafel my friend had brought for us (almost) made up for the Yankee's defeat.  And if falafel balls were baseballs  Maoz's would be screaming out of the ballpark at 300 mph -- a definite home run! I was lucky enough to have a taste of their fare at a Yelp event earlier in the week. The falafel was so enjoyable -- crisp on the outside  chewy & succulent on the inside -- that I vowed a quick follow-up to their actual location.  And I'm happy to report the in-store deal was as good as their special event fare.   Moreso  as many have written  the salad bar offerings (unlimited for a pita or salad falafel) are a serious step up in flavor  freshness and variety from any competitors. With personal faves of roasted cauliflower/broccoli (!)  the marinated carrots and the roasted red pepper strips  the bar sports an excellent array of sauces as well. James the manager told (almost encouraged) me to make repeat visit back to re-fill my toppings. With the full-sized $4.99 falafel pita  you can definitely get a good  and delicious  intake of your daily veggies.  I went full-throttle with the $1 addition of their mighty fine hummus.  The interior decor is minimal without being stark  and cleaner than many similarly sized campus quick eateries. A later lunch offered relief from the crowd other visitors reported  with fast service  multiple seating options and languishing at the salad bar.

A quest of massive proportions that has taken my taste buds through a variety of flavors and  textures. This  my friends  is the quest to find the best falafel in America (or at least the Bay Area). I used to HATE falafel and everything about it  until I tried the most amazing one in a shady market in downtown Tel Aviv  Israel.   Although I've always walked by Mao's and tried their samples  I never found the determination to walk in. I'm an avid meat lover  so having a vegetarian meal on purpose when going out is unheard of for me. This time  I decided to just go in and give it a try.   For $5.50  I got a falafel sandwich with hummus. This also comes with their very fresh salad bar and a variety of sauces. I piled on a big blob of fresh veggies and some tahini sauce and I was good to go. The thing that makes their falafel so good is the texture. Nice and crisp on the outside (not overdone)  but soft and chewy on the inside. Perfect combination that makes for a fantastic falafel. Unlimited refills of salad and sauce make it even better.   The guy at the counter is also really upbeat and very kind. Props to him for explaining all of our options. I just might come back another time when I'm feeling a falafel craving coming on.,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
17PRKve78GgzlHYdEbK7TQ,XBTtTiuZmLEhCz_mHe58sQ,1,3,5/10/2011,I'm a huge fan of the sweet potato fries that they have here. For $3.00  I would come here for the fries as a meal any day. Definitely go with the garlic dip on the side. 5 stars easily for fries alone. However  from here  it kinda goes downhill...  The meal deals that they have are definitely on the pricey side though. I ordered their combo number one  which is a eggplant falaffel sandwich  sweet potato fries (+$.50 to upgrade from regular fries)  and a drink. Price: ~$10. I'm all for supporting the underdog businesses here in Berkeley  but this is a bit too much for too little. They need to get their price down to stay in business as the place is always empty.  The unlimited refill filling bar is some what of a gimmick. It seems like quite a deal when you look at it  but when you actually try eating a pita and then refilling it  you'll see what I mean when I say it's about as hard as balancing a basketball on a toothpick (random analogy~).  What it comes down to is eating the toppings you fill onto the top of the pita  grabbing more  and repeat. It's incredibly difficult to get a bite of your toppings and the sandwich innards. You'll give up quickly and unlimited quickly becomes a few (probably 2) servings.   I would recommend  but price needs to be lowered and the idea of an unlimited bar would be better if they gave you a plate or something to put it on the side.,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0

It gave me my first falafel experience and it was a good one  but as time goes on  new relationships with other falafels are formed. By other I mean  better falafel places.  The ambiance of this place is really nice  very clean. I've been here multiple times and have had their falafels  arnold palmers  and fries. It's a bit pricey to buy the whole meal  but it sure does fill you up. I usually go with the half sandwich to-go because it really is that filling folks.   First off... the falafels are pretty small  about the size of a coat's button. here lies the problem. See  even though I commend them for having a wonderful crunch  it's size just keeps it from being moist. I thought that it was just because I had not put in enough sauce  but great falafels need not be doused in sauce. The salad bar is OK. I mean you could definitely stuff as much veggies as you want  but I like the taste of falafels  not so much veggies.  Secondly their sweet potato fries were a big let down. They were soggy and burned at the edges... no bueno. Get some advice from Saturn Cafe for their crispy sweet potato fries. I'll probably go back to maoz for a quick bite if I'm ever around the area craving for a falafel and too lazy to walk to sunrise deli.   PS.Their customer service can suck sometimes... really indifferent about you  especially the manager whom I have never seen smile.,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0
17PRKve78GgzlHYdEbK7TQ,7l1_eWZ2dAXswTeVL-hTNA,4,3,3/29/2010,I generally do not like falafels that much  but I like the falafels here  so I think that says something. The sandwiches themselves are whatever. I want to try the rice pudding  but a little scared to a the same time. Things are reasonably priced here. I love their tables  but they could do with more. I would study here because this place isn't all that busy  but their music is way too much for me. Please calm it down. We're not on a runway!,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1

But anyways  there is not a hint of anything that used to have a pulse here  and most of what they serve is even vegan  and/or gluten-free.  Now  my bestie is currently a vegan  which I totally support (from afar).  We ended up meeting for lunch (SAY WHAT) and so we ended up at Maoz (as neither of us had tried it  and of course  I had not thought twice about it after seeing that it is vegetarian).    The ceiling and walls are clean and green (themey? yes. but so cute) with exciting light bulbs hanging from the ceiling.    The menu proudly procaims VEG OUT""  BAHAHAH.  I got a Maoz sandwich and my friend got a salad box.  I got my sandwich with hummus and feta cheese  and doused it in salsa and garlic sauce (MWAHAHA).  It was effing delicious.  I usually need meat (in my mouth  har har har  get your mind out of the gutter)  but this was AWESOME.  I forgot how deliious falafel is  and this definately gave me a good reminder.    My friend got the salad box which got jam packed with fresh veggies and fun stuff (that I would not normally eat) but was apparently delicious.  We topped off our meal with a split order of sweet potato fries and a fresh squeezed lemonade.  These were HANDS DOWN the best sweet potato fries I have ever had.  DELICIOUS.  The lemonade was impressive (it's that fresh flavor).  As much as I eat like a dirty fat man  I can deal with this. I actually ate here just about an hour or two ago  and I'm already craving more falafel...""",1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1
17PRKve78GgzlHYdEbK7TQ,X6qcVCtL3hLx1KeOmwnoTw,2,4,9/6/2010,I've been a fan of Maoz for a long time. I first found out about Maoz high off my ass in Amsterdam. My memory is hazy  but I remember dousing the veggies with the white garlic sauce over and over again. Then I took a nap by the canal once the food coma set in.   I also had a torrid love affair with Maoz in the 5th of Paris. It's no L'as du Felafel  but it was the closest thing on Rive Gauche where my ladyfriend was living.   Let's be honest- it's all about that Salad Bar. Otherwise  there's better and cheaper felafel in Berkeley/Oakland...but that salad bar kicks ass  as does the Tahini and the Garlic sauce.   Side note: Moaz is an Israeli franchise started in Amsterdam. I have friends who would have a problem with me eating there due to the co-opting of indigenous Arab foods by Israelis. There's also the question of providing financial support that may contribute to the situation abroad... I see the problem with it  but I don't act on it.  I tend not to get politics/ethics involved with my dietary decisions (i.e.  I'm not a vegetarian either)...But for the sake of transparency  I thought I should make that public for those who would have an ethical/political problem with it.,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1

17PRKve78GgzlHYdEbK7TQ,fE-TihG2JZD0zqpCz-ynlA,2,4,8/19/2011,For the price it's a pretty good deal.You just order the Junior falafel or junior meal if you're really hungry and want some fries and a drink. It's more than enough food especially if you eat it there. --It's all you can eat toppings! Yeah  you can go back up the counter and refill your pita.  It's like eating an unlimited salad inside a pita THEN eating the falafel/ pita. Such a good deal. You could literally go back all day if you wanted.  And I encourage you to try the garlic sauce. It's heaven.,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1
17PRKve78GgzlHYdEbK7TQ,0Sxb2Oh_jONekZbBOlbPuA,5,3,5/26/2010,Last week I decided to check out Maoz  the vegetarian falafel chain that took over the spot once inhabited by the failed cereal joint. Upon entering  the decor is absolutely atrocious. It hurts the eyes to see the horrible lime green patterned walls  almost as if Japan in 1950 made their version of an American living room. Seriously. it's distracting.  It's not really a fast food joint because really  the workers aren't that fast. The food is fine  but it's a bit expensive for fast food and it's not exactly portable in those silly flimsy sleeves. It's $8.20 for fries  a falafel sandwich and a drink. The falafel if flavored well  though a bit dry  and the salad bar is great  but you can't take it to go because it's only great if you can load up your pita over and over again. Try the carrots  and the cabbage  and the spicy cilantro spread because they are fantastic and make sure to go back and continually load up your pita  because that's the only way it's worthwhile.  I will also say that their sweet potato fries are fabulous  especially with their garlic sauce  but it's still difficult to transport and not really worth the money it costs.,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
17PRKve78GgzlHYdEbK7TQ,Et73e-tKdZFAbQBZ5slmqQ,1,4,5/11/2010,Taste: 4 Value: - Service: 5  I walked by here on my way back to my place  and they were giving out free samples of falafel balls with yogurt sauce  which were pretty good. Definitely may drop by sometime in the next week to give the place a try. Any place that gives out free samples of good food gets a 5 for service by my book.  The meal is a bit steep ($8.20 for a Maoz sandwich  fries  and drink).,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
17PRKve78GgzlHYdEbK7TQ,5qzVDwvQ2DWVYdXmzqfSkg,2,4,1/10/2011,"Came here with the boyfriend and a Groupon in hand. We each got a Maoz (the falafel sandwich) and added hummus to one to reach the $10 minimum for the Groupon.  It was a short wait for our food to come out and then we quickly filled the pitas at the salad bar. They had a good varietty of veggies including broccoli and cauliflower  cabbage  cucumber salad  onions  etc. There were also sauces like tzatziki and garlic sauce.  I'd like to point out to some of the other reviewers that *technically* if you get just the falafel sandwich it does not say it comes with an unlimited salad bar. It says unlimited toppings"" below each the Meal Deal and Junior Meal Deal but the sandwiches don't say unlimited toppings.   The only problem with Maoz was that it was hard to fill the pita with the salad bar toppings because they put in the falafels before they give it to you and you have to hold it in your hand as you fill it because they don't have plates. All the salad bar toppings end up on top  which I guess that makes sense since they are ""toppings"" but it makes the bottom half of the sandwich pretty empty. This is where going back to the salad bar would be beneficial even if you just get a sandwich and not a meal deal.  Falafel is probably my favorite vegetarian meal so I'll be back  but I wish they would make the sandwiches unlimited toppings as well.""",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1
