_2E7DVE_tLxjhDHyZdRIug,309Zu1LghT1-XewnjrzBnA,3,4,9/9/2012,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,I consumed too much Mountain Dew here and shat my pants a few steps out the door after wrongfully mistaken diarrhea spray for a fart. As I ran to the bathroom and stripped myself of my soiled skinny jeans  I looked down and to my surprise  my shit looked like pure Mountain Dew. I'm not going to point any fingers here and accuse any kind of foul play  but it was a bit too coincidental for my liking. That being said  this place is great and I'd highly recommended their vegan pizza to any idiots like myself that don't be animal. I look forward to returning here again  but next time I'll be fully prepared with any extra set of trousers.
_2E7DVE_tLxjhDHyZdRIug,T1ggsBzQ5FJQMA59G9Jgsg,1,5,6/29/2012,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,I tried Zpizza for take-out last night. I'm not a big pizza fan but was having a casual dinner with my husband and another couple  and so decided to try it. The pizza was very  very good! We had ham and pineapple  which I didn't try  but which was completely gone by the end of the meal. We also had sausage and mushroom--only 1 piece left  and I got a wheat crust  basil pesto sauce  chicken sausage with vegetables. It was terrific! I will definitely be back. It reminds me of when I first tried Chipotle for mexican food--the difference was notable and I could feel good about patronizing them. Now I have a place for high quality pizza that is reasonable priced. Thank you Zpizza!
_2E7DVE_tLxjhDHyZdRIug,r-Ql-Mjf6qS8_q4ci1udMA,1,3,5/25/2012,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,I originally went to Zpizza because my dining companion was looking for somewhere that made gluten-free pizza; this was the spot. The gluten-free crust was really good: we got the pizza with artichoke hearts  garlic  and a few other topics: flavorful and fresh.   On another visit  I tried a slice of the veggie pizza  which was equally good. All in all  not the most filling slices in the world but fresh ingredients and friendly staff keep me coming back.
_2E7DVE_tLxjhDHyZdRIug,oA-2YR__3OhNM0Hd2dz21A,1,4,4/13/2012,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,We ordered the gluten free California version with chicken sausage. I was  hesitant since the California is all veggies  hence the side of chicken sausage.  My five year old son loved it and is on his third piece as I type. The crust is  very thin and crisp  almost cracker like consistency. Although I liked a charred  crust  it made it hard for my son to eat  especially as he's missing two  incisors. The taste was great  though  fresh yet the veggie flavors melded well  together. I found it cheaper to order a large gluten free pizza and freeze the  extras vs. buying frozen gluten free pizza from the grocery store. This will be  a regular eatery for us.
_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA,vbWlJQldwYuO--NYLFKfeA,4,3,6/1/2010,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,If I'm craving pastrami and I'm on foot in Westwood  I will come here.  It's nothing spectacular but I refuse to give a penny more to Jerry's deli.  I will give them an extra star for a decent burger and CHEAP beer though.
_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA,zIq0Rec9-EYoKznTYswZuw,2,4,12/15/2010,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,4 stars for the only thing I've ever ordered and will always order:  The Rachel!  Pastrami  swiss cheese  coleslaw  1000 island dressing  on grilled rye bread. For ~$9  you get a pretty filling sandwich + chips (or fries).  It's really good... the pastrami is not lean at all  sometimes a little bit chewy but whatever  it's still yumm.  I tried the sweet potato fries - they were ok  but a little too soggy for take-out.  Their menu is kind of overwhelming  so I don't think I will venture far from my tried and true.  But trust - the Rachel is hella good!  Service has always been really nice.  Overall  I recommend stopping by if you're in the neighborhood.  Tip: Sign up for their frequent buyer card... you save some change every time you order and can buy a pint of their house brew for real cheap (like $2? I think).  That reminds me  you can't drink beer at the tables outside the restaurant =(
_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA,oKonm6MkUQ8vJ8sUIVlyVg,3,2,9/13/2012,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,More like 2.5 stars.  I dislike the clusterfuck of toppings on the dogs  burgers and sandwiches.  A cut above many of the other shitty similar places like Pink's  Marty's  and Jeff's  but there is definitely something missing here.  If you order something simple like a hotdog with mustard and onions and some fries  you are not going to be disappointed.  A cold 22oz beer in a plastic cup is available on tap and there are some specials on Monday or game day or something.  Food in Westwood  with the exception of some wonderful Persian places  is not particularly noteworthy.  The Stand  therefore  is right at home here.
_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA,Za35VFCB9QhTgb0Pl13oWg,2,4,8/18/2011,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,If you want really good service  this is the place to go. Yes  the food is good  but the whole appeal of this place for me is that I know I will leave satisfied. One time I came here with a friend and ordered something I didn't end up particularly liking. One of the staff members told me that they'd be more than happy to change it for another menu item for me at no charge. I thought that was really awesome  and I ended up loving the chicken sandwich I traded it for.   They have great hot dogs and burgers  and great deals if you have a Stand Card  which is free :) I also love the location  nearby a lot of cool little shops  etc.   I will definitely be back when I'm in the area :)
_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA,#NAME?,1,3,5/15/2011,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,I got the Philly Cheese Steak with a large order of sweet potato fries for about $14.  I was disappointed that they were out of their draft root beer which I've heard good things about.  It wasn't the best sandwich I ever had but it wasn't bad.  The fries were pretty good.  I think it would be a good idea to stick to their hot dogs which I hope to try next time!
_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA,R64tASLbS4_ZKntGLrEBYw,4,4,6/23/2012,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,Tried The Stand with some co-workers the other day  and was really happy with what I got.  I kind of don''t see the point in paying $5 for a hot dog  and most reviewers didn't seem the like the hot dogs here anyways.  But there was a cilantro lime chicken sandwich on the special menu  and it totally sounded worth getting.    Our food came out quickly  and was very nice.  My sandwich had grilled chicken with red onion  avocado  a creamy cilantro dressing that wasn't too strong on a warmed bun.  Delicious!!!  Instead of fries  I got the homemade potato chips  and they were quite good.  They serve homemade pickle slices that I should have tried  because apparently they are quite good.  But I definitely liked the self-service drinks & the TVs that were playing Golf Channel  so I will be back for sure!
_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA,vpTKQM8m3N8cQi0POE0EDQ,1,5,12/2/2011,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,Amazing food and even better customer service.  The draft root beer and the fire fries are definite must haves.  I love this place and on a Monday  the deals are kickin.  Come here at least once a week.  I brought my dog once and I had to eat outside  they accidently served me a beer (which you can't have outside) they comped me a root beer and told me they'd get me back next time.  Always amazes me how friendly they are here.  Very progressive as well.  The fact that on a Monday  I was able to get a beer  loaded dog and special fries for under 8 bucks  makes me smile.  In tough times  nothing beats the stand.  Hands down.  Also recommend the chili.
_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA,ieHlLVlT4RjKPabWfMAwRA,1,4,9/6/2012,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,"It was first weekend free museums courtesy of Bank of America  so my husband and I decided to head over to the Westside to visit the Hammer -- a place neither of us had been to.  We were going to go early afternoon  but on the ride over  we started to realize we hadn't eaten anything since early yesterday  and it was time to fix our blood sugar levels.  That's when I uttered under my breath  Oh  I wish there was a place like The Stand [in Encino]  because i can really just use a good hot dog and some fries.  And some pickles.""  Hmmm  maybe we should just Yelp?  So  we parked at the Hammer and proceeded to see what Yelp would take us.  And  just like it was the hand of God  fate presented us Westwood's The Stand  literally a block away.  I could not believe it.  Thinking it was too good to be true  on the walk over  I was half expecting the place to be closed for the weekend  or anything but open  but not only was it open  it was just the beginning of the lunch rush  so we got there at a perfect time.  We both shared a chili dog  a brat  and some fries.  YU-UUUUMMMM.  It was really all we needed  and the price was just what we needed  too.  And  the exhibit at the Hammer was tremendous  I'm glad we caught it while it was still open.  Altogether  it was a great day to hang out in Westwood.  I highly recommend!  Now  Tha Stand... you just gotta move closer to Burbank...... okay????"""
_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA,hkDKc46Ba7Q-tQ1pDW0J_A,1,4,12/23/2011,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,Awesome Burgers and Pastrami Place. Sweet potato fries please and Monday Night Dollar Dogs from 5pm-close FTW!
_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA,FaVZNH16KEYdiBdjh8B2pg,1,5,3/17/2012,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,First  I'll admit  this place is not really 5 stars  but I don't think it deserves the 3 stars it currently has on yelp  so my rating is a bit inflated. The family and I were stuck on Westwood on a Friday afternoon. If you know anything about LA  it is that freeways are toxic at this time of the day. So we decided to just hang out around the area and find dinner. A quick glance through yelp shows that this area is pretty weak as far as food goes. There was the typical fast food joint that we try to avoid  and there were some high end eateries but all in all nothing that really jumped out. Then we saw this place and found it only has three starts  but we figured how can you go wrong with burgrers   so we gave it a try. It did not disappoint. Aside from the great service that we go  I thought my burgers was great. I added chipoptle to it and was not too overpowering and all. The wife had a chicken burger with onion and avocado and was also great. It wasn't like the best burger and it was a bit on the expensive side but considering the location I'd said it was worth a visit. Then again maybe UCLA students just have high standard for food and that would explain all the bad reviews around Westwood  I guess I'll never know
_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA,Lfbfjl7kxJIxLBRBzxNOPA,2,4,4/30/2012,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,The stand honestly isn't deserving of a 3 star rating as mentioned by another yelper.  I honestly think it's more of a 4 star establishment. It would seem that this restaurant is yet again another victim of yelp bullies. Their food is tons better than fast food and way cheaper than all the other sit down restaurants in westwood.   What I got Cilantro lime chicken sandwich: this sandwich was really good and what really made it was that freakin sauce!!! it was PHENOMENAL. like seriously crack to me!!     Sure it was more expensive than the other chicken sandwiches  but hey I wanted something with FLAVOR! if I wanted something on the plain side  then I would've chosen their regular chicken sandwich.  But why would I do that?? It would be plain and it's not like  I could complain. I ordered it lol.  Obviously if you don't want something plain then you should order something that has more oomph.
_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA,ghvUFa0oPTGJW-ZnNuDASA,1,3,2/21/2011,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,"The food here is generally good. The service is a bit spotty though. I had the brat dog (if that is indeed the name)... bratwurst with sauerkraut. I had it come with chips and a root-beer float. There were two cashiers serving us. The one who served me left afterward and one guy stayed. The latter guy was kind of annoying.  The dogs took a bit long to come out but my friend's dog came incorrectly (i.e. split and without the veggies she asked for). We waited about 10-15 min for her dog though there was only one other ordering customer. Mine came out 5 min after. The guy came back 5 min later after giving mine with a smile on his face... obviously to hit on my friend. OH! Did I get your order wrong..."" Blah blah. My friend said it was fine and he said he'd bring another one even though she would eat what she had as she was pressed for time. All this time I still hadn't gotten my root beer float. (And Tina MAD  Tina SMASH when thirsty!) While he was asking her about the dog  giving all those cheesy smiles. Blech. I said I also hadn't gotten my root-beer float yet and he shot an ugly glance at me. Gee thanks  asshole! I just want what I paid for! Sorry to rain on your parade but your job should come first. Because of that this review is -1 star.   I haven't had the burger yet but I'll try it sometime... hopefully that same guy won't be there. The food generally seems pretty good... the only thing that seemed kinda expensive were the shake and root-beer float (~$4 and ~$3.50 respectively... to put that in perspective the sausage/dog meal/sandwich was less than $5)."""
_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA,N56ozwQSTQAoRrNppUbtrA,1,4,5/14/2010,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,"Probably one of the better places that we've stumbled upon around Westwood Village.  It could be a little bit pricey if you tend to have a bigger appetite like me  (from running/biking/swimming all the time...) but a tasty meal.  We opted for sweet potato fries instead of their chips too which added $1.50 per meal.  Total for a burger and hot dog for me  and a veggie burger for my wife  one soda  and a $5 off coupon in the entertainment book and it still came out to almost $30.    If you want to save a little  sign up for their Stand"" card.. You get 5% off.  They also have a deal on Mondays where their regular hot dogs are $1  and their special ones are like $2.50.  WAY cheaper.... I'm sure Mondays will be the days you see more college students.    Monday nights we'll now have to choose between Lamonica's 2 for 1 deal  and this place."""
_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA,rPUlxSUccXRYidxUkog15A,3,5,8/15/2011,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,I LIVE for The Stand's veggie burgers!  Their Westside Veggie Burger is absolutely phenomenal!  I could eat that thing almost every day.  For real. Their specials are really good  too.  I took my bf here not too long ago and they had a burger with goat cheese and arugula - he got beef and I got a veggie one - they were awesome too.  Their fries are also really good - sweet potato fries are amazing! I've been wanting to try a cobbler  it's one of my favorite foods of all time.  But I haven't gotten around to it.  Let you know whenever I get here again  because I will definitely be getting it next time! And I haven't had the milkshakes myself  but a couple of my friends got them once when we all went to The Stand together  and they looked REALLY good. Note: one of those restaurants where you pay  take a number and then pick out your own table. And you get your own drinks.
_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA,qkrFXjIhsnVKM5451ImKLg,2,3,3/18/2010,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Came here before my main goal= Diddy Reise cookies!! and decided to have a hot dog.  I like the look of the place. Standard ALL American eatery with beers AND root beers on tap!??!!!! Plus  ESPN on the flat screen.  It didn't take me long to order  I got the Dwntwn LA Dog. Waited less than 10mins and it came to my table.  Nothing great about it except I can see this place being a cool hang out. Total $5.43 w/ no drink.  Hey wait I can get a bacon wrapped for $4 standing on the street corner!! lol!! blah! I'd rather save hot dogs for those drunken moments! But would grab a drink here IF i went to UCLA!!
_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA,r5kMmPM0Lu3nOjFP46VizQ,1,4,3/21/2012,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,Great burgers  great chicken sandwiches  great beverages  a great location  and great fries!  Every time I've gone to The Stand  I've left needing a bed and a nap.  The customer service is good  you just walk up  place your order  get  a number  and sit down.  Then the server brings over your food.  The burgers are cooked to order and you can get a nice medium rawr burger if that's what you're feeling!  You can also get delicious fries  but their sweet potato fries are reallllllllly good.  I also like their cole slaw  and their chicken sandwich has hit the spot when I've been eating lighter.  So why  why did it only get 4 stars when this is a 5 star review?  I've been there 5 or 6 times and only once did they actually have the root beer on tap!  I want that root beer  the one time I had it my mouth was engorged in amazing flavor ecstasy  and to have it taken away from me more than once after that was enough to make me drop a star.  I don't know what they need to do  but they need to have that root beer to compliment those amazing burgers!  As soon as the sign for draft root beer catches your eye  it's really all you want  and I just felt it a cop out to not be able to get it all the time.  But even though my lust for root beer hasn't been satiated  the hunger has been and I can sleep at night knowing that The Stand makes awesome food!  PS:  I worked in Westwood for a little over 6 months and food in Westwood really isn't good  and The Stand  really stands out as a place with potential!  Keep up the awesome food!
_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA,dYW_SXyg3a50sSJmif0sBA,1,4,1/21/2012,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,Had their bacon cheeseburger with a fried egg... awesome!  Would definelty stop by again when I'm in Westwood.

And yet The Stand offers some amazing deals as well as tasty  good quality food  great beer and wine selection and a clean  comfortable atmosphere.   There's a lot to choose from and unlike many similar places  you can customize your sandwich or burger to get exactly what you want. I had the Patty Melt  which was delicious  and not too greasy. The bread was crispy and the burger was done just right. The fries are thick home style. I also had a salad which was fresh and really good.   I liked the food and the ambiance far better than the delis in the area. It feels young and hip  exactly the kind of place a college neighborhood should have. If I lived around here  I would come to The Stand all the time. Drinks were up in a few minutes. Food took a little longer but was hot -- brought out right when it was ready.
_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA,OIIrsGzk5pNP70SDeqM1zA,1,4,4/27/2012,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,The only gourmet burger place in Westwood. Between 1145am - 1245 the line gets long so be smart. Beef fans? try ABC Burger or BBQ Burger.

_ewEvGkaCtNMzhqgg7STLA,BVffQtwOInGXn-ONvYxksw,1,2,5/20/2010,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"When deciding to have a burger  there are certain caveats that go through my  mind  chief among them:  Man  this is a lot of calories  so this better be good.  I've had Umami burger quite a few times  Comme ca a few times  Pie n Burger. Those are my LA faves.   But i'm not a snob in this regard as I frankly love Big Macs when the mood strikes. Just make it tasty.  I can't put it more plainly:  The Stand has one of the most bland and tasteless burgers I think I've ever had outside a school cafeteria.   But don't associate it with cafeterias: the burger looks edible. It has its own sauce  cheese (not american  which is their first mistake)  what appears to be fresh chuck  and grilled onions (my preference is raw  but I don't mind either).  What is missing is seasoning. If there is any  it completely missed the meat. I literally ate half the burger. My interest in the whole thing shut down after about the 3rd bite.  The fries are equally bland  and a bit too largely cut for my taste.  What elevates this to a two star and not a one star is the Big Red Chili Dog. The taste of the dog is spicy and has a nice pop. The chili is meh  ok"" and the bun almost certainly is store bought.  But it's not a bad hot dog. I'd have it again  if I ever had to revisit this restaurant.  But it doesn't save the damage done from the burger. I would say it's a bad thing if I leave your restaurant regretting eating the burger  because now I'm still hankering for a burger  instead of being satisfied with the Stand.  Such is life  I suppose. If you eat here  enjoy the hot dogs. But you'll be unsatisfied with the burger."""

I asked if it's because today was the expiration date  and he just said they stopped taking it.  That sucks!   So I just ordered small sweet potato fries.

Not impressed at all.  It seems no one can match McDonald's fries.  Apple pie was decent.  Will have to try a milkshake sometime.
_GTu9MAHtHMkpIUbGSMsdg,N-mUtn-1afSWIRvg-LCT-Q,2,4,6/20/2010,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,Not as classic as the Burbank location and a bit smaller  but the staff is great and the food is good.  I've been to a couple Bob's elsewhere and they were crappy.  I was happy to find this one as the food reminded me of my childhood.  A worthy Bob's.  I heard they are run by the same people as the Burbank one  and you can tell.  Update: Sad this location closed.  It wasn't very buy every time I went in  so I wasn't completely surprised  but now I have to drive to Burbank when I have a Big Boy craving.
_GTu9MAHtHMkpIUbGSMsdg,dZSOSp6D1Z19WDjaFI6V_w,2,3,5/2/2011,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,A little bit of nostalgia never hurt anyone.  After the South Pasadena community egg hunt we ventured over to Big Boy's for burger's. There's ample parking (2 hours free) at the parking lot  just a few steps away. Service was exceptional and we were looked after by the hostess  our waiter and store manager.   The order; Bob's original combo  kid's chicken fingers and patty melt combo. All burger's are made to your liking. The patty melt that my husband ordered looked tasty and will be my next choice on our next visit. The onion rings were really tasty too  with a nice seasoned batter and crisp rings. My son loved their fries  which were cooled slightly in comparison to mine  most likely to avoid any burns. I noticed and I appreciate the thought.  This is certainly not my first choice when it comes to burgers but for steady service  food and an atmosphere that is family friendly ( a big plus in our house) Big Boy's is a certainly on the list of places to go.
_GTu9MAHtHMkpIUbGSMsdg,xZonb1VVTs6Iza_ADa-New,3,3,8/19/2011,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,I have found memories of Bob's big boy as a kid  I think it's where my parents did my restaurant training since they seem kid and family friendly. And legend has it that one of my uncles once showed up to a birthday party of mine with a full size Bob's big boy as a gift for me (allegedly).   I've wanted to check out this local (Pasadena) Bob's big boy for some time and since I installed the groupon app and saw they had a $6 for $12 deal I thought the timing was right. A meal for $6 is hard to beat.   I order a meal that came with what was a cheeseburger  fries and salad. I also got a drink and it brought my total to just under $12.   I got the food and the first thing that stood out where how small the fries and salad portions where. I think I might be better if they just did one side but did more of it.   The second thing that stood out was the burger; it reminded me of a big mac with the third piece of bread in the middle.   I dug in and the burger was fine  not great not bad  the fries where good  and the salad was ok. I ordered with salad with blue cheese and although the salad seemed drenched in dressing I couldn't taste the blue cheese.   It's hard to complain when you get dinner for $6 but the meal didn't really stand out. And if I had paid full price I think might have been more upset. If you haven't been its worth checking out but see if they have a groupon deal.
_GTu9MAHtHMkpIUbGSMsdg,iRGk2XzqvotdOUTtoITIsA,5,3,5/8/2010,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,I can't remember what the old Bob's Big Boy restaurants were like even though my parents dragged my screaming child self to them fairly frequently. This newest incarnation serves simple food with no frills and does it quite well.   Food: I scarfed down my classic hamburger which was drizzled in creamy  tangy sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_GTu9MAHtHMkpIUbGSMsdg?select=Ib7Q6Q5mhrgwHL65MvgjwQ). The meat was tender and was sandwiched between two slices of cheese and a assortment of the usual veggies. No skimping on the fillings either! The buns have that characteristic flavor of being toasted with butter. My sides included the coleslaw and two dipping sauces  but there are other choices on the menu. All in all  this is not the most healthy meal  but it is pretty satisfying. I also sampled some of the fries. I'd rank them as average.   Atmosphere: During the lunch hour  this place is packed full of baby boomers. You can cut the nostalgia with a spork. It's pretty loud inside and during my one visit I noticed there was a LOT of trash and spilled dry condiments like pepper and salt on the ground. Gross. Watch out for the giant Big Boy out front. He's super creepy.  Service: Our waiter was very friendly  but seemed rather forgetful. We did get our food  but only after some order corrections.   Synopsis: Burgers are a bit pricey for what you get  but they do taste very fresh and delicious. It beats McDonald's at any rate.

Most of the big boys are old  parking is horrible  or is just super busy to the point you want to leave. Parking ~ not a problem because there is a huge private parking in the back. This place opened couple of years ago  so you can tell its pretty new. And even when its super busy  its not super loud to the point you get a headach. Also  if you have kids  they are really nice cause they really try to put a smile on every kids face (I always see a few leaving with ballons). The waitress are super nice  and are one of the best waitresses I ever had! The food came fast  and my glass was never empty. Super friendly  and fast service? What more can you ask for?! And my friend & I LOVED our burgers  and the sauces were the best we ever had! (YUM to the ranch & thousand island) And gotta love that big boy statue! Always take a picture with that huge boy before I go home. Gotta love it :)

Anyway  the Bob's Big Boy went into the space formerly occupied by Baja Fresh (four Mexican restaurants in one block just didn't work)  and all they did was basically install booths and change the decor.  It is much more appealing now.  The restaurant has a comfortable and festive feel to it.    Now on to the food - I ordered the original double decker hamburger  and it was delicious.  It was one big sloppy mess  with their special sauce  but it was great.  Their special sauce (whatever exactly it is)  adds a kick to it that makes it much more tasty.  Fries were fresh  and in a way  reminded me of In N Out fries.  The double decker hamburger combo also came with a generously-sized side salad  with a choice of dressing.  I ordered dessert - an apple pie a la mode  and the slice was fresh and hot.  Dinner for one  with everything I've mentioned  complete with a soft drink  came out to about $15.00.   Service was friendly and attentive.
_GTu9MAHtHMkpIUbGSMsdg,CgVVzYbZOMeeiLxnmusLYw,2,2,4/7/2010,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,So I was on a casual date and had a hankering for cheese fries...  This Bob's Big Boy is definitely not the same quality as the Burbank location. They took over the old Baja Fresh location and made good use of the space  but it is definitely not an improvement.  The decor is the same old school 50's/ 60's diner type that Bob's is known for  but there's where the similarities end with the Burbank location.  The staff was barely cognizant that we were there. After a wait (I guess ample opportunity for first date conversation) they wanted our orders.  Ten minutes later  burnt greasy cold old looking french fries lathered in cheese came out. Er  this was not what I thought I'd be getting. Definitely sub par considering any number of places (cough  cough  Johnny Rockets or Pie n Burger) do their cheese fries warm and fresh and juicy looking. This plate just looked stale and old. My date's soup looked like it was freshly popped out of the can and equally cold. If they can't do these simple items  I hesitate to think what their entrees look like.   I was severely underwhelmed. Too bad because I really like the Bob's Big Boy in Burbank. Guess they can't all be good.
_GTu9MAHtHMkpIUbGSMsdg,ONRfrPpU89ji0MRpM1GRbw,1,3,2/5/2010,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,I came in here with a group of 8.  The place is a bit small  but nice.  The service was friendly but seemed to get orders mixed up (to be fair  there were 8 of us and it is a new restaurant with new staff).  The food had some inconsistencies.  The burgers were good  as was the chili.  My chocolate shake was a generous serving size  good consistency  and decent flavor.   The fries were a pathetic  oily  soggy mess.  After all 8 of my parties meals were done  all that was left to be seen were heaps of uneaten fries.  Overall not a bad place to stop for anyone in the area who used to frequent this once popular restaurant.  Maybe one day they'll get the fries right.

Won't go back.. I rather go to the Counter in Pasadena for better burgers or McD to be cheap.   After posting this review  I received this message from the owner.  Thanks Ho ! I assume you came for the free big boy day and then spit on us after we gave you free food.  Your kindness is greatly appreciated.  You are right McDonalds is way better than Bobs.  And Bobs is three times as expensive as the counter.  Do you realize that comparison to these restaraunts is wildly inaccurate ?  The Counter is fine dining with check averages over $20 and McDOnalds is fast food.""   I thought about going back and trying the chili or something else.  But  after this message.  Why bother?  If you can't give a honest opinion or review without getting harass  why yelp?    And no  I did not get a free food on Big Boy Day.  I actually paid $12.03 for a Bob's Big Boy Burger  Fries  and a soft drink  plus tax and tip.  Next time  I would gladly pay over $20 to eat at The Counter."""
_GTu9MAHtHMkpIUbGSMsdg,lv-xoErGl2so-TL8xt1sxA,2,4,4/16/2011,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,Honestly surprised to see the complaints about the service  as it's easily a strong point for this Bob's; perhaps things have changed in the past couple months. Staff is friendly  fast  and competent  and the restaurant is clean. Portions are generally good  food is decent but not amazing. Selection is underwhelming  and if you frequent here  you'll be running out of things to try.  That said  their patty melt is delicious  and their chili is the sort of cheap  tasty stuff that heart attacks are made out of. The burgers leave a bit to be desired and tend to be on the skimpy side.  It's a nice place to grab a bite if you're visiting South Pasadena late at night.

Yes  I am channeling Debbie Gibson for my review of Bob's Big Boy. Sadly  the Bob's Big Boy of my childhood truly now exists only in my dreams."" My partner in crime and I found ourselves across from the Pasadena BBB at dinner time and in a fit of nostalgia thought we would check it out for old times sake.  As soon as we walked in we were greeted enthusiastically by Bob  not Big Boy Bob but waiter Bob. He was very friendly and quickly seated us and took our drink order. Our server Aria arrived quickly with the drinks and took our food order which consisted of the following:  Super Bob's Big Boy Combo ($9) Basically this is a larger version of the regular combo (bigger patties and more cheese) along with fries and a salad. I ordered this without the bun...I know  I know  but I am gluten challenged.  Chili spaghetti size ($9) This is a huge hamburger patty covered in chili spaghetti and comes with soup or salad.  Hot fudge sundae ($4) Vanilla ice cream  hot fudge  shipped cream  and cherries.  We ordered our salads with the world famous BBB Blue Cheese dressing. The salads arrived and we excitedly dug in...unfortunately my salad consisted of brown  slimey lettuce. I mean really brown  really slimey lettuce that you bought a month ago and suddenly find at the bottom of your crisper drawer. It was beyond gross. Our lovely waitress really tried to make it right. Eventually she brought me a new salad with fresh lettuce...but I was really kind of grossed out by the whole thing.  My burger arrived sans bun  and looked gray and lifeless on my plate. There was indeed alot of oozy cheese  and it tasted OK. It was not the epic burger experience of my childhood dreams.  The Chili spaghetti size was huge  and pretty much lived up to the memory my PIC had in his head of what it used to taste like. And seriously  the portion was monstrous.   The sundae was just an ordinary hot fudge sundae...not bad  not great...really just OK.  Overall the entire experience was OK. What really stands out here is the friendly  efficient  authentically great service. What does not stand out  sadly  is the food. I also have concerns about their standard operating practices...that brown  slimey lettuce should never have gone out on a plate and there were fruit flies flying around in the restaurant. We will not be returning.  No  no  no  only in my dreams As real as it may seem It was only in my dreams (*sheds one tiny tear*)"""

My memories of Bob goes back to high school...heh...you know  the caveman days  cuz I'm so old  ;) My HS use to steal the rival cities Bob and place it right in the middle of their football field.  We even stole it one year and put it on their football coaches front yard.   That's not why I love Bob's the way i do though.  Bob's was the place you went to for your first date.  Chocolate shakes  french fries and chocolate fudge cake.   And then there was the Bob's at our mall.  As a teen I spent hours in that mall with my friends and there was only one place we would eat.  Burger combo with a chocolate shake.  mmmmmm So is this one comparable? Of course!  It is reminiscent of the Burbank Bob's where I've spent many an after-club night at attempting to sober up....or dancing in the parking lot....or eating at a table while a friend sleeps head down on the table. On this particular night I ordered the cheeseburger wrapped in lettuce.  Scott ordered the bacon cheeseburger & Noah ordered the chili size.  We were all extremely happy with our orders and the waitstaff were always there when we needed them.  It's comfort food at it's best and they even change it up if you ask them to.  I drive by this location many times during the week and I can confirm that this place is busy all of the time. We will hit this place every time we need some sweet family quality time with an old friend that serves reliable cozy foods.

Oh YEAH!  My family loves watching food network and my kids saw a special on Bob's Big Boy.  Ever since then have wanted to try it.  I heard they opened a smaller Bob's on Del Mar Blvd so we tried it when we visited Pasaden recently.  I don't care for this micro-Bob's Big Boy restaurant because it just seems to contradict the Big Boy"" concept.  After walking through the patio seating area  you enter this dark  small dining room.  I'm used to the old school Big Boys with the spacious dining room  long counter seating & bright natural lighting from windows.  For this location  eat on the patio so you won't be shocked at how small the interior seating area is.  Service was friendly  attentive and responsive... 5 stars!  The food was very good.  My kids had cheeseburgers and fries.  They are actually cheeseburgers snobs so I was surprised when they told me how much they loved their cheeseburgers.  I asked them what makes the burger so good  they said the meat patty was what tasted the best.  I had the four-piece Pappy Parkers Fried chicken with salad (bleu cheese dressing)  cole slaw and french fries.   I always loved Bob's fried chicken and this serving did not disappoint... crispy broasted chicken  tender & juicy on the inside.  My son said it tasted better than KFC... and I have to agree with him.  The cole slaw was limp & bland  fries were hot & crispy and I almost forgot how great Bob's Blue Cheese salad dressing was... creamy & tangy.    Overall  this Bob's Big Boy continues to the tradition of good food in a family-friendly environment  it's just a little small."""

I remember coming here religiously. Saturday I was finishing up with shopping and was waiting at the signal light at the corner of Del Mar and Lake Ave. While I was waiting for the WALK"" sign I could see the Bob's Big Boy off in the distance. I was hungry and decided that I would eat there tonight. As a kid my brother and I would bug my mother to take us to Bob's to get a hamburger and to get the comic books they use to sell showing Bob's Big Boy doing the adventure of the month. With that in mind I wanted to find out just what and why in the hell we use to come to Bob's in the first place.   This Bob's opened up  down from where I live  about 1 year ago and I felt my visit was lone over due. With hunger grumbling in my stomach I decided to try what they are know for  their hamburger. The people that work their are friendly and my server directed me to a booth from where I ordered my ""Super Big Boy"" with fries. I also ordered it with a cup of coffee.   Waiting for my burger I had I listen to some guy loudly talking in the next booth to someone about the second coming of Christ and how 1 million believers will disappear from the face of the earth when he comes. I'm use to blocking out B.S. so when my hamburger arrived I saw the second coming of the burger and when it came the saliva started to form. My server asked if ""there was anything else he could get?"" Deep in the recesses of my mind I was saying ""ya get the hell out of here so I could eat my burger.""  After taking a photo of my burger I grabbed it  held it up to my mouth and bit into it. Hot damn tamale it was juicy  tasty and delicious. Yes  it was everything that I had remembered from my childhood. With every bite kaleidoscope visuals of my childhood were bleeding thru. The meat was juicy and the cheese excentuated the taste  and I like how the 3 buns were toasted  with what I think was butter. I asked for grilled onions on my burger.  Can you tell that I will be back? Yes  the answer truly is a Big Boy ""YES!!!"" Oh and next time I'll be coming back for breakfast. They open at 7 a.m."""

This location is table service with waiter/waitress service. This location is not too big inside (remember what is was like at Baja's) but now there are booths and tables. They also have tables outside (covered). You can also order food to go.   Just had the Bob's Original Double Deck hamburger combination for lunch. It was delicious. It brings back memories.

I guess they're known for their burgers considering the Big Boy statue up front is holding a burger.  I went with the Big Boy classic double-decker cheeseburger with fries.  The burger tastes like a burger  but nothing special.  In fact  I could probably make a better one at home.  The fries are a bit soggy so that's disappointing.  If you want a better burger  just go to Islands for their lunch specials.  The pulled pork sandwich is pretty good actually.  The BBQ sauce has a little zing to it  which I like.  The best part about the whole experience was the service though.  Our waiter  Jacob (I think that was his name)  was awesome.  It was busy at the time we came in but he made sure no cups were empty and everything was fine.  His service compares to a restaurant of Ruth Chris' or Fleming's.

I noticed that this branch of Bob's opened on the site of a former Baja Fresh (which  by the way  was great--why did you leave  BF?).  This imparts a weird geographical vibe to the place; Bobses that I recall from my now-distant SoCal youth were large  sprawling  airy joints that took up like a city block (e.g.  the one in Burbank)  while this one is basically cramped and labyrinthine like the fast food restaurant it recently was.  I hadn't actually been to a Bob's Big Boy since I was a kid  and nostalgia was like 99% of the reason I was there.  And having now gone as an adult  I can safely say that the experience was nothing if not adequate.  The service was punctual and perfectly polite.  My turkey burger was solid  if unspectacular.  The iced tea tasted exactly like iced tea.  The prices were completely fair for what we got.  Bob's is utterly  completely  and entirely ... fine.  On balance  I can say only that I have been to this restaurant  found it entirely serviceable  but am hard-pressed to think of a reason to return when there are so many distinctive and memorable places to eat in the area (Counter has much better burgers a block away  for example).  Oh  and for what it's worth  families w kids dominated this place.  When I was in the lobby paying I felt like I was in the Lollipop Guild scene in Wizard of Oz.  UPDATE!   I went back to Bob's in Pasadena just tonite  and can report with confidence that this joint remains utterly  totally  completely and entirely ... adequate.

It must be 15 years at least!  The remodel is actually quite nice  especially if you get a booth (see pic).  The covered patio also has heaters and ceiling fans  but not sure if those are holdovers from when this was a Baja Fresh.  At any rate  the food is unremarkable.  Salad & turkey sandwich on grilled sourdough are very standard  and competently prepared.  The menu reminds you a lot of Dennys  and whether that's good/bad/neutral  I'm gonna leave that up to you.  Breakfast food is served all day.  My server  however  was extremely polite and very on top of it  so that's the main reason this Bob's Big Boy pulls up to 3 stars.

The first time I went here I figured they could justify such a cheap price for the buffet by charging for the naan. I was wrong  the naan is free unless you get the specialty naan  then it's a couple of bucks extra.   The food here is pretty decent  not the best indian food but it's way decent for the price. I'm a huge fan of the zucchini and  of course  the tiki masala.    The food's a little hit or miss with the rice sometimes being overcooked  but overall  it's a way decent meal for the price.

Woohoo!  Yumtastic Indian food  beautiful / mildly classy interior look & feel  pleasant Indian music playing in the background  excellent service  and an outstanding price.  The reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is because they don't include mattar paneer  vegetable biryani  OR samosas in the buffet (ever) and these are three of my fav Indian dishes...

Also rice  salad  and papadams as well as melon and rice pudding for dessert. Four sauces like raita  tamarind  and that green minty sauce are available.  Good overall. Nothing stood out as great or bad. The tandoori chicken was moist which is better than most buffets  but pretty bland flavorwise. It tasted better shredded into the chicken tikka masala.  Good place for starving students and the value concious to fill up.  Side Note: Cool elephant thing on the wall above the buffet and be sure look up and check out the fabric covered ceiling.

The closest you'll come to price is Biryani House  which still runs you $8 for one naan and one dish. Oh and did I mention a free refillable soda is also included in the price?

Not only is this the best cheap Indian buffet in Berkeley  it has some of the best overall food as well (see rankings below).  -The naan is some of the best you can get in Berkeley  soft and chewy/ crisp ratio nailed to perfection.   *CRITICSMS*:  -The food tastes great..when it's warm. Which is not very often. You have to have your timing right so you don't get there at an off hour when nothing fresh is coming out. Otherwise  the quality of the food quickly deteriorates to be far worse than many of the restaurants I've ranked below. So it's really a hit or miss depending on freshness/warmth of food. I don't know why for the life of them why they don't keep the food warm!  -The food will put you to sleep. Out of the Indian food in Berkeley  this is probably some of the most heavy in terms of you feeling groggy/ lethargic afterwards. My reccomendation: Don't eat too much of the cream-based dishes  that's usually the culprit.   - NO variation in selection. I've been here a lot  and the dishes are almost always the same  save perhaps one dish which I don't bother touching most of the time anyways. So you can get bored of these place real fast  even if though the food is good.   Service: Pretty good in my opinion. The Nepali waitress usually there is very nice and greets you with a smile every time; the owners do not when they are managing but the service is still there. When my favorite dish was gone at 9pm  I requested more even though the place was deserted  and the waitress happily ordered more to be made from the kitchen. That's great customer service and a win in my book. Oh and your water glass is always full  what more can you ask from a buffet with no tip?   This is how I'd rank the taste of North Indian Restaurants in Berkeley (this takes into account everything  naan quality and consistency  curries  etc.) The list is not exhaustive yet  as this is my first review.  Now I know a lot of you are going to disagree  but keep in mind this is coming from someone who is a native Indian. I'm sure for non-Indians many of these restaurants seemingly serve great"" Indian food.  **I will keep updating this ranking list **  Updated 6/24/2010  1) Flavors of India / Kabab and Karahi (tie) 2) Himalaya 3) Urbann Turbann ($5 Cholay wrap: best value for your money  period). 4) Punjabi By Nature 5) Chaat Cafe 6) Priya 7) Viks (yeah  I know I'm going to get a lot of flak for this one  but it's true folks  severely overrated due to bandwagoning)  8) Breads of India (OK  but overpriced) 9) Biryani House 10) Khana Peena (the one on Solano  a little better than the other one) 11) Pasand (OK  but severely overpriced) 12) House of Curries (College) 13)  Kabana (Great food loses massive points for racially based treatment of customers) 14) Tandoor Kitchen 15) Khana Peena (the one on Shattuck  absolute trash  avoid)  16) Indus Valley Restaurant (literally serves frozen vegetable curries)  **Now if I called Khana Peena Shattuck trash  then you can imagine how the following are...yeah...these don't deserve to even be ranked**  House of Curries (Durant) Naan N Curry"""

The decor is nicer than what you would expect for the price they charge.(BTW... look straight up at the ceiling for a pleasant surprise) Their food is tasty enough for me. My favorite dish was Chicken Tikka Marsala. I liked how they labelled each item.  Cons-  Barely enough variety but acceptable for $8. Some yelpers commented that their sauces are watery.(they mean thin consistency vs thick but not diluted or weak in flavor) I like thick curry sauce to pour over my rice.BTW their rice is like dorm rice.edible after you drown it with sauce.  Their Tandoori Chicken was OK. I expected it to have more flavor & alittle more spicy kick to it but it satisfied my craving for meat. It irritated me that the staff was very slow to replenish the Tandoori Chicken. I watched them restock the other items but it took them a longer time to bring out more Chicken. It took them so long that I had to ask them if they were working on it.They said they were aware but it still took them a long time even after I spoke up. I think they need to monitor the food more closely & cook more food before it runs out.( especially the Tandoori Chicken).  I plan to come back once in awhile but the low variety & slow restocking made a negative impression on me.

And sure  it's not the most delicious indian food i've ever had  but it's still pretty tasty and a buffet  and I wanted to go back time and time again  and the meats were plentiful and the sauces thick and delicious.  totally not the worst indian buffet i've had  in fact  pretty darn good.  did i mention that it's the cheapest indian dinner i've had in a long time/ever?    mmm  punjabi  i'd almost move to berkeley just for your unlimited indian food access all night long.

All of these things will keep me coming back. But...The service was lacking. I just came in today with my boyfriend for the first time. We were originally going to go to Saturn  but decided to give this place a try instead. The girl at the counter seemed as though she didn't give a shit  and had a slightly demeaning tone. I had to get up and remind them of our naan as no mention of bringing it to the table was mentioned  and I had to get our own water and refills  because even though it's wasn't even busy and the girl was just sitting there  she couldn't manage to see that we may need some refills. If they don't want to have to serve at all then why don't they just keep the water in a fridge like they do at naan and curry?

The other important consideration would be the location. Right on oxford street.  Hubby and me walked in for dinner yesterday  and were impressed by the spread and the large Ganesha mural. What we were not impressed by was the quality of the spread.   Spinach and garbanzo  Broccoli masala  Vegetarian kurma  Rajma  Fresh beans in masala and Dal makhani. All these curries will get 2-3 on 5  mainly because the base sauce for many of them was the same and really not exciting from a mix of flavors perspective.  The naans will get a 4.5 from us. They were made fresh and were crispy and soft.   The rice was nothing to talk about  and the rice pudding was blah!  Didn't try the salads/raitha or the non vegetarian dishes.  May go back here coz it's cheap and serves Indian!
_jg2zJPu7iNI0Ct0XNN3YQ,inOXqtTQmr8fMwhrQT_HNg,2,4,4/25/2011,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,Forget Naan n' Curry  come to this place.  It offers more bang for the buck.  The buffet is only 7.99  with endless naan  so you really can't go wrong for the price.    I can recommend the indian salad  the seasoned rice  the naan  the BBQ redened chicken drumsticks  and especially the chicken tiki masala.  A single plate of the mentioned food above would easily run 8-9 bucks at another Indian joint  so why not get here and get it endless?  Parking really sucks (street parking only).  Sometimes  the service is lacking too because there is only one waitress for the entire restaurant.  While the food is not spectacular  its been consistent for the times I've eaten here.    PROTIP:  Take the 1R and it stops right by this place.  The rice pudding is good too!

It blows Naan N Curry out of the water. Thats not saying much because naan N Curry is probably the most disgusting indian restaurant in all of berkeley.  They also have fresh naan  made to order  unlike NNC which has them sitting out and getting stale.

At first glance  it doesn't seem like the place to go to  due to the lack of customers (at the time). The $7.99 buffet deal seemed too good to be true. But since we were all starving and didn't want to stray too far from our apartment  we gave it a shot. To make this review concise  here are some quick things to consider about this place before you decide to take that $7.99 chance.  Pros: - Chicken tikki masala. Wow. Sweet & creamy goodness. Get it. A LOT OF IT. - Naan is usually served hot  fresh  and as much as you want. If it's not there though  ask the waitress/waiter. - For a buffet  much of the food was quite decent. I could actually taste some quality in a dish.  Cons: - Not the greatest service. The waitress  after seating us  wasn't prone to helping us out unless we prodded her consistently. - I noticed that the salad  fruit and some of the curries weren't very fresh. Somewhat old actually. We ate around 7:30ish (which is late)  but still. Just a warning. - DON'T expect a lot of variety in these dishes. There weren't a lot of choices; at most  there were 7. A few were empty throughout the night  despite the waitress saying they were working on it.""  Overall  it filled my stomach well. It isn't a bad restaurant to go to for some near-broke college students that are completely devoid of food. But  it isn't a place I would want to go to again. One-time experience is more than enough.   Fun fact: Although they do play Punjabi music  it's funny that the workers in the back are blasting out Latin music  muffling out the Punjabi environment lol."""

Not all the dishes are absolutely amazing  but the ones that are are definitely enough to fill you up. I definitely recommend the Tikka Masala as it has a much more savory (and less sweet) taste than that of other South Asian restaurants in Berkeley. They also have fresh-made naan  nice and hot  served to your table when requested. Everything else is up to your taste  so there were definitely dishes I wasn't fond of but overall the experience is great every time I go.

I love how Cafe Strada has this ambiance of--well  what a cafe should be: people having conversations  college students studying  and plenty of outdoor seating. I feel one of the things you should do in college is to actually get a cup of coffee  sit outside  and read a book. It's just one-of-things on your to-do list  I feel. I'm a huge fan of their Mocha Bianca  mainly because of its rich and aromatic feel. Creamy and light. Frothy and humble. Just what coffee should be.   -1 however for their whip cream they put on top of the coffee. It's TOO thick. Personally  I think if you're going to own a coffee shop  you should take time to make your own whip cream. Whip cream that foams just slightly  that gives"" slightly when you put it on top of hot coffee so that when you sip on it  it just froths in your mouth. I think their whip cream just doesn't cut it. It sticks to the walls of your mouth and doesn't give a bouncy texture.   Service is wonderful. They make their coffee fast and it's pretty decent.

It's also nice to make a Strada run at 11:30pm when you know you're going to be up late. The streets are dark and the crazy intersection is now deserted. The warmth of the coffee in your hands is a comforting reminder that Strada will always have your back when you need a caffeine boost.   I stick to the iced coffee or espresso.

There wasn't an overpowering taste of artificial white mocha nor of burnt espresso. It was a perfect balance. Even a regular coffee is the perfect blend. There's no reason not to go here if you're a student at UC Berkeley. It's right next to campus and has very reasonably priced coffee. It's a nice change in scenery for those who are trying to study but not feel constricted in a library. I love this place!

If you want a quiet place to study by yourself  don't come here because there's lots of groups and chatter going on. I wouldn't recommend coming here at night; I heard that someone threatened customers and stole their laptops sometime last year.

You'll always get your drink within 2 minutes from ordering it  so that's always a plus.  Always crowded inside  but if you wait long enough  you can get a seat!  My all-time faves are the House Iced Coffee and the Bianca Mocha. nomnomnom.  Open late  so you've always get 'till 12 to study! I go here on the weekends  when the library closes early... or when I am too lazy to walk anywhere far.   The most convenient location on the southside of campus!

I have tried their small MOCHA BIANCA  or white chocolate mocha  which is around $3. It is soooooooooooo sweet  and so wonderfully yummy.  Another time I was waiting for a friend and was guilted into buying a HOT APPLE CIDER for $2.75. They heat it using their foam latte machine thingy  which was appropriate for the chilly Berkeley night. The apple flavor was very rich and smooth. But  I can't figure out why I chose to pay $3 for warm apple liquid...And  on top of that  my friend and I moved our meeting on campus. So that guilt trip was FOR NAUGHT.  Heat lamps are outside  small tables everywhere  and a bathroom hidden around the back. Really  who can forget the place where my friend went to the bathroom and found a turd that missed its destination into the toilet bowl and instead graced the rim of the toilet. Oh Berkeley.

A friend of mine forget her bag at the cafe this week. Her iPad was in the bag.  And guess what-  the fine people at Caffe Strada had found it and kept it safe.  For that reason alone -- know that if you leave a Rolex or your laptop there by accident  it will most likely be there if you go back.

I'm the type of person who loves their drinks piping hot  and they do it each and every time. I've had one bad experience (thus resulting in 3 stars). I ordered a large Americano  and it ended up tasting burnt. It just taste like smoke and I was displeased. Hopefully  I will never experience that again cause I really do like the coffee here!

However  if it's late at night and you need coffee to pull an all-nighter  do come here.  Their coffee is pretty good - more on the strong side. Even their cafe au lait (milk with coffee) is pretty strong. The place is usually packed with students thanks to its convenient location.  They have wi-fi and the large number of heaters they place outside makes it possible to sit outdoors late at night. I like how the cafe has both indoors and outdoors seating  but the place does look prettier in photo rather than in real life.  Last note: their bathroom is outside.

I say this based on years of experience living and working in Berkeley  traveling  and Strada actually being rated one of the best cafes in America by some source that probably has never been there.  Don't get me wrong  the location and ambiance are outstanding.  The ample outdoor seating area which flows into the cozy indoor seating really works well  and is a nice cornerstone to College and Bancroft.  If they didn't completely botch the three most important factors for a college cafe  it would be a great study or hang out spot.  In order of importance  Strada completely fails at the following:  1. Coffee 2. Seating 3. Power/internet  1. The coffee is atrocious.  Anyone who tells you otherwise likes grotesquely overfilled pint-glass americanos and charred-bean cappuccinos.  This is no hyperbole; it is that bad.  I don't think the baristas"" receive any training whatsoever other than ""push this button till full"".  They will seriously extract the hell out of every shot until the water runs clear.  Another big pet-peeve: they give you to-go cups when you ask for a regular cup at least 50% of the time.  2. Every table is totally fubar  bent beyond the point of no return.  Is there anything worse than trying to type and having your lopsided table spill your coffee everywhere?  I think not.  It's actually really funny to periodically take notice of all the people fiddling with rolled up napkins  rotating  and propping--it's a fools errand people  the tables suck as much as the coffee.  3. This is a catch all category of amenities.  There are approximately 5 outlets for the 75 or so person capacity.   The internet  i'm pretty sure  is based on cup and string  carrier pigeon  or telegraph technology--quite possibly all in series.  And the propane heating system?  Lets just put it this way  if your replaced the people with eggs  some would be cooked in a minute and others would be preserved for a milenia.  In summary.  Strada sucks.  It has always sucked  and has actually gotten worse over the past 6 years.  But they will always get business because of their location.  My advice  buy your coffee anywhere else and use their tables."""

I could totally see myself spending a lot of time here if I lived in Berkeley.  My 3 star rating is a reflection of lacklustre drinks and baked goods. My hot chocolate ($2.95 for a large) was okay but could have been better. The chocolate chip cookie I ordered was pretty weak. Not nearly dense enough and not at all chewy.

The Hot Apple Cider is also really good on a chilly day. The lines get long (literally out-the-door-long)  but the drinks come out super fast. I love that they have outdoor seating for enjoying a nice day outside!  Cons: You can't have the best of two worlds. Service is quick  but the staff is not very friendly.

There's only one restroom here so most times you have to wait in line.  I found that it's really difficult to try to study here unless you are able to focus and concentrate while overhearing neighboring people's conversation.

What I love about this cafe is the outdoor seating area surrounded by boxed plants and greenery which makes me feel as if I am sitting in a courtyard.   The food is not why I go here  and the espresso drinks are decent.  On my most recent visit I had a cappuccino which I thought was actually very good  with silky foam and not too much milk.    What I am about to say  I say with utmost affection.  The patrons here are often the nerdy types  representing students  faculty  and staff from the nearby law school  business school  architecture and chemistry departments.  This also reminds me of one guy friend of mine with whom I visited Cafe Strada long time ago and he introduced me to steam milk with almond syrup.  I don't know why  I just remember that it was a sunny morning and I was surprised at his choice of drink but I now sometimes get it here too  and it makes me happy.  I have other memories of this place  too.  Like a long long time ago it used to be called Cafe Roma  then because of lease problem I think the ownership changed and the name changed to Cafe Strada.  But the best part about the place has stayed pretty much the same and for that I am grateful.

I've frequented Strada during the many years I've been at school in Berkeley and it's a great place to to grab an Americano before heading into campus. Also a great place to study during sunny days. They have long lines usually at the top of the hour on weekdays  but the people behind the counter are efficient with a smile.   Caffe Strada is known for their drinks  not for their pastries and bagels.  I suggest to order drinks only. I've always stuck with the $1.75 Americano  which I think is far more superior than the other Americanos in the other coffee shops.  Also  there are no bathrooms in the actual cafe  but you can always go into a campus hall just located across the street.  Cash only!

The coffee and espresso drinks  as they always have been  are excellent and difficult to match  even in a quirky coffee town such as this.  Nothing I've ever purchased here has been unfit for consumption.  In fact it goes much beyond that - everything I've consumed from Caffe Strada has been delicious and fulfilling.  What really turned me off this time was the excess of technology in use by the crowd.  I don't know if it's because of the ipad  or the surge of netbooks and portable computing power that has changed the culture of humankind  but this frequently social and cozy place has become a junkyard full of robots.  Case in point - try to find a single table inside that isn't occupied by a laptop.  I thought I had walked into a computer lab at Soda Hall.  It doesn't just stop there  but spills out into the patio  turning a shady breezeway into a disutopian technodump.  Try not to trip over a power cable.  Better yet  try to find people actually having a conversation...with their mouths.

At the corner of Bancroft and College  its a GREAT location for people watching in the sunshine enjoying some free wi-fi as you sip your beverage.  I get one of two things. On my major sweet tooth days  I go for their Bianca Mocha.  So delicious and super sweet  I have friends that ask for half the cocoa butter usually and thats a bit more reasonable sugar wise.  More often however I get an iced or hot americano and a biscotti (both kinds are delicious) and both items together add up to a mere $3  a DEAL in this crazy Starbucks day and age.

It's a nice atmosphere for people who don't mind the noisy whirring of coffee machines and bustling cafe sounds. Their cakes and pastries look delicious. Their brownies are super fudgy! Like  eating dense  greasy brownie batter rather than a baked product. But I have no issue with that. I've had their famous mocha bianca in the past--I'm not a coffee drinker at all  so I can't really judge. But warning: it's an extremely sweet drink.  When I think Strada  I always think GSIs. It's where they hang out. The cafe is usually fairly crowded with Berkeley students  faculty  and staff.  Overall  I think Strada would become even more popular and make even more money if they started selling sandwiches or other entree-type foods.    Pros: desserts  Cons: choppy wi-fi.

I'm pretty sure it was stale BEFORE they microwaved it. Why the f*** would you microwave a bagel? Then of course after it cooled for 30 seconds it got so hard that biting into it made my gums bleed.  Outdoor seating is nice  but for the good of all humanity stick to the drinks.

I go here at least 4 times every week during the school year. I survive on their espresso and white mocha drinks. I have done some important reading and writing here. The atmosphere is arguably inspirational.   Problems: cash-only and bagels that are not toasted. Still  I am eternally grateful to this place. It's convenient  it has caffeine (and is open late!) and it has outdoor seating that constantly reminds me that I'm in California and should stop whining.

There are heat lamps overhead  but if it is breezy  that doesn't help you much.   Located towards the top of Bancroft  you get a nice little walk uphill if you're coming from Telegraph. One of my professors always set up her office hours here instead of being on campus.   If you can snag a spot indoors  there is a cozy nook towards the back. It's not as stuffy (as in hard to breathe) as Cafe Milano can get  especially when you're upstairs and the heating is on!   Free WiFi  friendly staff. This place is much more a summer cafe than a winter one!

Quality = Strong.. I've had their house coffee  mocha bianca  cafe latte  etc.    Location = Prime.  Corner of Bancroft/College  doesn't really get much better than that.  Ambiance = Perfect cafe setting  cute/quaint vibe.  Definitely feels one-of-a-kind.  You'll find friends catching up  students studying/Facebooking  people lost in novels.  I am a big fan of their outdoor patio seating.  There is limited seating inside.  Downsides =  + Wifi:  What Wifi? I spent half an hour  tinkering with their WiFi with no success. To be fair  the only times I tried their Internet was during Finals week when the place was jam-packed. + Cash only

I haven't given the entrees many tries  but the hot sour soup is good  war wonton not so much. Didn't give it 5 stars since the service is a bit slow and unfriendly.

My problem with a lot of dim sum places is that the food in the carts gets stale and isn't always served at its peak. Luckily for Chang Luong  they don't cook any of the dim sum until you order it. So although it may take a little longer for your food to come out  it's always hot and fresh which is why I eat here regularly.  Recommendation: - SHUI MAI - BEEF RICE NOODLE WRAP - BEEF BALL  ENJOY!

I would say this is a pretty decent alternative if you can't make it over to Oakland or SF for really good dim sum.  It's cheap and they serve your food very fast.    The dim sum is just ok.  By ok  I mean it tastes like something I could buy at 99 Ranch and reheat.  They serve dim sum all day so I suspect that's probably what they do.  They're fried items taste fresher but I think that has more to do with the nature of it's cooking process more than any sort of quality.  Their dishes are cheap but small.  Their baos are TINY!  Order two if you have three or more people.  If you're desperate  Chang Luong will do.  But if you can  drive out to SF.  Or better yet  BART it.  If you're a UCB student  I'd highly recommend putting that class pass to use and taking the 51 to Oakland Chinatown.

Unfortunately  the bad was BAD! I should've known better than to order from a place in the main college area  but was attracted to the free delivery  decent prices  and seemingly authentic menu. Also  I've loved the food from Sun Hong Kong  which is also in the college hood. Too bad it's an $8 delivery fee at SHK!  I got: spicy beef chow fun  sauteed snow peas  salt and pepper pork chops  and chicken wings. In hindsight  I realize the menu is not cantonese-oriented  and more szechuan. Makes sense that the spicy beef chow fun was the most palatable item.   Other than that  everything was greasy  disgustingly battered  and I could practically taste how dirty the kitchen might be. Forget eating leftovers for a few more meals - that was $28 worth of garbage. With the poor quality of everything  I can only suppose that the dim sum menu is composed of cheap frozen food that is steamed back to life for service.
_mv3DhRD3L3okFXYjxX_Cg,5Q-47TdDDTrjngUFiZ-ljQ,1,3,3/14/2011,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Discovered this restaurant when I was looking for a place to eat before a an Asian American Film Festival showing at the Pacific Film Archive.   It's located in a building that's occupied by 4 different restaurants -- Lotus Little House (on the street) and Kimchee Garden (in back at the end of a walkway which may have been a driveway in the past) on the 1st floor and Chang Luong & Cafe Durant on the 2nd floor  which are accessed via a stairway on the left in a stairway (that's hidden from the street) in the walkway towards KimChee Garden.  Chang Luong is located in the back of the building opposite Cafe Durant which is in the front and offers an outdoor patio overlooking Durant Avenue.      I've eaten at KimChee Garden and Cafe Durant before and they were ok -- not awful or great -- as far as I can remember.  However  KimChee Garden was closed  Lotus House looked too noisy and cramped and didn't feel like having Mexican food and it was raining  which ruled out Cafe Durant.  So  that just left Chang Luong.  The room was empty and looked somewhat dark and dingy -- took a table under the only skylight which offered a little light.   Was just thinking of getting some BBQ pork won ton or chow mein for a quick bite but was surprised to learn they served dim sum.  So  ordered several basics: shrimp dumplings - ha gow  tripe  foon jow - chicken feet  don tat - custard tarts   cha seiu bao - steamed BBQ pork buns   see jup pai gwat - pork spare ribs w/black bean sauce and new mai gai - steamed glutenous rice filled w/chicken  chinese sausage and other things wrapped in a lotus leaf.   Was then surprised that the dim sum was pretty good -- not great but not awful either.  The ha gow was first rate  the tripe and chicken feet were also very good but I would have preferred a little more spice  the pork duns were ok -- not very large and no much filing but tasted ok.  The custard tarts were slightly overcooked but ok.  The pai gwat was a little undercooked and didn't have enough black beans but was ok and the new mai gai was ok too.    There was a little mix up when I asked for gai lat (chinese mustard) and the foreign-born waitress thought I said gai lan"" -- mustard greens.  Blamed me in Chinese for not speaking clearly but my guest said she heard me ask for it correctly -- it's one of those foreign born towards American born Chinese insults/conflicts that only ABCs will understand.  BTW  got the gai lat but it was very watery and runny -- should have been much thicker.    Guess the waitress was too pissed w/me to serve us again and another waitress (American born) helped us from then on.   Told her about the misunderstanding and she said the other waitress probably misunderstood because she's from China; speaks Mandarin and only a little Cantonese.    No service problems after that.     I wouldn't go out of my way to eat at Chang Luong again but would if I'm in the area and am in the mood for dim sum -- and not Mexican  Korean  Indian  hot dogs  hamburgers  pizzas  etc. which are all options only feet away..  The food was fine  even if the decor were a bit lacking.  But  if it's a sunny day and you want to drink some a beer (and eat some Mexican food  which isn't required if you buy a beer) out on the patio  Cafe Durant would be the better choice."""

Probably wont ever go again.  I can tell that a lot of the buns and egg tart (dan tat) are microwaved.  The egg tarts were served in foil and were cold in the middle but really  really hot on the foil.  I've had shiu mai there that tasted microwaved  too.  The food was cheap  but I'd rather pay to not eat their food.  Bad experience overall.  It's unfortunate that there's not much good dim sum in Berkeley.  Go to Oakland or SF to get the real stuff.

Not only are the prices incredibly reasonable  the amount of food you get for the price is great. The restaurant was busy (and also really nice) and completely full but it took only a couple minutes for our food.   My single char burger with cheese  the fries  and the mocha shake were all fantastic  flavorful  hot and fresh. I keep reading people comparing this to In-n-Out; it's most definitely an accurate comparison  and having had both I'd say they're both equally as good  but Habit's fries were much better. But I don't usually like comparing restaurants to other restaurants - if you want In-n-Out  go there  if you want Habit  have Habit. But both places are different and have their own unique good things about them.  I'd most definitely recommend Habit and would return the next time I'm down there  and actually can't wait to. Sitting next to one of the giant picture windows  people watching people downtown while eating a great burger  was really nice  and even though the place was super busy and filled with hungry college kids  it wasn't too noisy at all. A nice atmosphere.  Try one of the shakes while you're here - thick and creamy with a few different flavors to choose from. So good!

Since the closest In-and-Out is approximately 15 minutes south in Arroyo Grande  people say it is pretty much the same. The Habit Burger  all though decent  cannot be compared to In-and-Out.

I was genuinely surprised by the flavorlessness of my  burger.  How something so awash with melting cheese and grilled onions can taste that bland and washed out is a mystery.    It *looked* like  In n' Out but tasted like Mickey D's.    The fries were okay but the onion rings were redolent of the lunchroom cafeteria.   Service was quick and friendly  and the pager system for signaling when your order is ready is genius- anywhere that currently shouts out names or numbers should take a close look.   The environment was pleasant  plenty of well padded booths with street views.     The food was priced competitively  but unfortunately the quality suffered for it.  Clean and pleasant as the environment was  I found myself waxing nostalgic for the grime  quirkiness and *flavor* of dear  departed favorites like Scrubby & Lloyds or Eds.  The convenience of the location & the atmosphere are undeniable  but if I want a generic cheapo burger there are plenty of fast food chains around to serve my needs.  Disappointing.

Now back to the delicious waffles. They were so good. I got the waffle with nutella ice cream in it with strawberries and bananas. And it was so good.

Because I was a dollar short from getting ice cream on my waffle (what a bummer  since everyone else was)  I decided to get chocolate syrup  strawberries  and bananas on my waffle instead.  Turned out that it wasn't a bad decision at all! The waffle is just as good as it smells  maybe even better! It is EXTREMELY light and fluffy but also the slghtest bit crunchy... not even close to being a soggy  mediocre waffle. Every bite was another step on cloud nine. Disgustingly delicious.

I think that's what he said...well either way I remember he said more people prefer speculoos over nutella...so we decided to try it. I really honestly think it was the speculoos that put me over the edge and why I can't get these waffles out of my mind! I really loved that stuff! So good and tasty with the bananas too! I don't know what else to say but that all I know is that I am now officially addicted. Need to get me some soon!

It tastes like it's pumped full of preservatives and artificial crap  not to mention lack of pearl sugar.  People think twice about getting a non Liege waffle from this truck. Yuk

But yay  today they came to me! When I heard they were going to be OC Din-Din  I was super duper quadruple-y excited! I rushed over right after work and what I found was..  Waffles de Liege is one spectacular food truck run by even more spectacular people! The waffle itself ($4.50) was pretty damn orgasmic topped with some caramel ($0.50) and speculoos spread ($0.75). Have you guys ever had those amazing Biscoff cookies on Delta flights? Speculoos spread is like Biscoff butter! So freaking good. The waffle was nice and caramelized  and I was happily surprised to find actual little pearls of sugar inside the waffle! One waffle was more than enough to satisfy both mine and Nam's sweet tooth. Needless to say  I left very very content. Gotta try it with the ice cream next time! :)

I decided to get the waffel with nutella and carmal sauce topped with fosselman vanilla ice cream.. let's see how it taste.... My gosh!

Don't think of this as an ordinary waffle  because this is something extraordinary!  A chewy waffle with caramelized sugar on the outside (just enough to add a little crunch).  Add to that a variety of toppings  and you've got yourself a tasty dessert!  I've tried it twice now  both the same way  just topped with English Toffee ice cream from Fosselmans.  I wouldn't want to pile on too many toppings because then you are going to obscure the deliciousness of the waffle.  I think it was worth the price  yes it isn't cheap  but you've got the quality waffle and the Fosselman's ice cream.  Think about what you pay for a good dessert in a restaurant.

Finally they came to a food truck gathering in North Hollywood. They did not disappoint. Most amazing waffle I've ever had. Fluffy  moist  and sweet I've never tasted anything like it. With caramel and whipped cream it made the perfect dessert. The waffle was a little expensive for the size  but I've paid more for far inferior products.
_QNKVyihvoeCL8873l8x8Q,XloVHIYwGoLUN1ZACnxNwQ,1,4,6/13/2011,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,Is it safe to say at this point the food truck experiment has somewhat bottomed out?  They're god damn everywhere and the slow  honest  post-hype truth has finally simmered to the surface -- most of them suck.  And yet  few beacons of worthwhile mobile eateries still diligently scour our eternally clogged roads.  Waffles de Liege is one of the few worth seeking out.  Simple execution but everything done properly.  Waffles embedded with sugar pearls for a crusty sweetness in each bite.  Chocolate sauce with more emphasis on deep bitterness to stay in balance with the waffle.  Strawberries that are actually ripe when served.  Fosselman's delicious textured ice cream.  It goes on.

In my opinion  describing this waffle would be like describing the waffles at Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. They are different for reasons you will only understand by actually trying it yourself. I will misconstrue your understanding so just go out and get one. Also  do it right and get a scoop of ice cream to go with it. Chocolate or strawberry are great flavors to choose  but the choice is yours!  The price is not right in this situation and the reason for why I do not give it five stars. I hear Hot Spud serves a liege waffle also that I am going to try once they open back up. Hopefully this will give me something to compare this waffle to.

I have been waiting for these guys to get back into the OC area. Yesterday  they were at Irvine Lanes and I had to try it. I had the waffle with chocolate syrup  bananas  strawberries  and strawberry chocolate dipped ice cream on top. The waffle was crispy and lightly burnt. The powdered sugar helped kick in the sweetness of the waffle. The fruits were fresh and the chocolate hot. The strawberry chocolate ice cream was my favorite part. Make sure to try out this truck!

The waffles from this truck is to die for!  Fresh  yummy and then some.  They use this thing called pearl sugar that makes it good every time you take a bite.  Then they use ice cream from a local place on the east side (Alhambra or somehwere there).  I tried just the plain old vanilla with some strawberries and maaaaaan.  You have got to try this truck.

Damn tasty waffles  hot out of the press  with a multitude of toppings for your culinary pleasure.   I was undecided at the time  so I went with the example that was posted on the truck. Fresh strawberries  bananas  chocolate syrup and Fosselman's vanilla ice cream. It was pure heaven. Waffle was warm  slightly chewy and not overly sweet. A little hard to cut with a fork.  Next time I see this truck  its gonna be the Nutella  bananas and caramel. Or maybe the  Speculoos. I don't know  Waffles de Liege will make your waffle however way you want it. So far its been fantastic.

Super chewy  sweet and yummy  with a slightly crunchy crust.  I thought $4 for one piece was a really good deal (it was about the size of 1 and 1/2 Nintendo DS's... which is quite a bit bigger than mentioned in another review  not sure why)  I got mine plain.  To be honest  I feel like if I got it with ice cream it would have been a bit too over the top/sweet.

This truck simply sells waffles. Just waffles.   Even more strange is that it seems to have only a few different options for that waffle. Plain. With Nutella and best of all with Fosselman's Ice cream   Now it's not just that this waffle would be good if it was just by itself. Because the waffles are indeed damn delicious. But you add in Fosselman's Ice Cream and you have heaven.   For all of you who didn't grow up in the San Gaberial Valley  Fosselman's Ice Cream is that go to local ice cream producer that every town seems to have. The one that all the locals swear by.   So you put that high end quality ice cream on your already warm and tasty waffle and you have yourself some crazy sorts of deliciousness. Again  the simplicity to this truck is just refreshing.   Besides that  it's a waffle truck. No need to complicate it up with other menu items. They make the waffles good and cheap and that's all you need to be told to sell you on it when you see the truck parked on the curb.   Service was fast as there wasn't much of a line anyway. Food and prices were pretty cheap. In fact  really really cheap compared to other food trucks. It makes for a great dessert item after cruising around other food trucks.
_QNKVyihvoeCL8873l8x8Q,B_jRIC5RvoPZHOF6cRSFew,4,5,4/5/2012,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,This is Waffles de Liege's 100th review!  Holy crap have these guys worked their ass off to get this business up and running. From having to drop dat knowledge on us peoples about what makes Liege waffles different from Brussels waffles to all the food truck festivals they've been a part of to the cray cray marketing (Loveline  NPR  etc.?).  Anyway  I've had this bookmarked to review for almost a year. I tried them out at a food truck meetup in Puente Hills. The line for Waffles de Liege was long  but they killed the wait like a champ.  What did I order? I forgot  but it was something with nutella and ice cream for sure. Like everyone else has said  they source their ice cream from Fosselman's  which is another one of my favorites over in downtown Alhambra.  Anyway  I've been made a fan of Liege waffles by the likes of these dudes. It's a different batter that makes the waffles denser and it seems that they take much better to caramelization (you know--the GOOD stuff) when cooking. This caramelization creates this ridiculous crunch and al dente texture on the exterior while leaving the center extremely soft and fluffy.  Fucking. Magic.  TL;DR - Buy a waffle. Or 6.

It was a hot day and we were just talking about how we wished we had gone to Fosselman's for ice cream earlier when we encountered the Waffles de Liege truck. And they use Fosselman's ice cream!  We were fixated on a photo posted on the truck and told the guy taking the orders that we wanted a waffle exactly like that with toffee ice cream. The waffle was heavenly; best waffle I've ever had.  The ice cream lived up to my expectations. I was a happy camper.

You might think: great  what's up w/ this quirky word...like  is it short for spectacular whoop-de-doos"" or something?  Maybe...But seriously--there IS such thing as Speculoos!!!  So Speculoos  I think  is an obligate food-to-die-for phenomenon.  Before I explain this new food fondness  I ambulated w/ CSULB + Yelp buddy Viet T  plus 2 other college buddies  at the Too Fat Too Furious Friday food truck round-up at Best Buy  near the Imperial Hwy/Beach Blvd intersection.  Out of the 7 food trucks (of ~15?!) we spent our hard-earned $$$ for  I decided to Yelp first about Waffles de Liege  signifying the $4.50 carbohydrate.  I let my avid sweet tooth friends do all the choosing  eventually customizing in the Original Liege Waffle w/ Fosselman's Chocolate-Covered Strawberry Ice Cream  fresh strawberries & bananas  & Speculoos--which was accidentally on the side  rather than spread intentionally & lovingly on that squared carb--for a whopping total of $9.25 *o_O.  Honestly  friends  WITHOUT Speculoos  this dessert would have been rated 2.5 stars--maybe less.  The positive part was that giant  hefty scoop of ice cream  guaranteed at 1000% that at every bite of this very thick & subtly buttery-tasting Belgian waffle  there will be a forkful of the smooth-to-""fork"" ice cream to drag along.  Deng  if we remembered to grab one plastic knife  it would have been almost trouble-free to mess this treat up =_=.  Yet  I'm terribly sorry for my friend who chose the chocolate-covered strawberry ice cream  but I frankly thought this dessert was awfully PRICEY for a boring sweet taste that I instinctively rather find crappy parking & head to DTLA's Syrup Desserts.  Thus  that waffle desperately needed at least 1 outstanding ingredient to enliven this showy dessert...  ...And that's all thanks to Speculoos.  At additional 75 cents  it's a Biscoff cookie-made ""butter"" more easily spread & scooped up--AND more costly by the jar--than equally coined Nutella.  Viet & I were trying to decode what constitutes this pleasant  spinal cord-tingling zing  & after minutes of what was that ""cereal [we] used to eat when [we were] little "" Speculoos was best reminisced as a velvety  European-style Golden Grahams  taken as liberally needed for the waffle/ice cream/fruit combination.  If this truck is driven to the area at ambulate-friendly distance  say  the Picnic at the Plaza at Los Alamitos  I wouldn't mind ordering the waffle w/ this nostalgic treat  fresh fruit  and the out-of-the-blue Blueberry ice cream from Fosselman's xD.  In the end  I will give Waffles de Liege a better-than-average 3.5 stars--yet optimistically more if I can gobble the aforementioned all by myself o_o.  Thanks  Viet  for storytelling about your NY find of the spectacular whoop-de-doo!"""

These waffles are some of the best waffles I've ever had and I cant believe they are out of a truck!!!! My sister and I gave this truck a visit for dessert. We ordered a waffle with toffee ice cream. Our total was $7.00  but it was totally worth it. The waffles weren't big  but they had a great firm texture  so it never got soggy under the scoop of ice cream. The waffle itself was sweet and the ice cream had a delicious toffee and cinnamon flavor. With every bite  my love grew and excitement for the next. By the time I got to the middle of the waffle  it was soft from soaking up all of the delicious ice cream. mmmmmmm! hot and cold  one of my favorite dessert combos.

The last time I had a liege waffle was at syrups dessert and I thought that was okay; Waffles de Liege made a better liege waffle.   I shared an order with my sister: we got the original with nutella  almonds  and strawberries (I wanted bananas  but they didn't have any that day). It had a slight crunchy exterior and chewiness in the middle  but I think it was a bit dry. There wasn't much nutella  but the rest of the topping was a good amount. I think a scoop of ice cream would have helped  but we were planning to take it home to eat (we ate it there instead)  so we didn't order it.  I think I would be back if I'm craving something sweet; otherwise  I rather save the money and go to a different food truck.

All were pretty disappointing compared to the European counterparts. They were usually just fluffy giant waffles.  Finally  FINALLY  LA has the real deal. Crunchy exterior with crispy pearl sugar that's been baked into create the coating and then a supple and chewy inside. I would have been content with just a powdered sugar rendition but my food mate wanted ice cream. Either way this waffle truck is on my list of trucks to look for.

Like a guy who was told to jump off the bridge  I did what was told.  I'm glad I did because these waffles  just the plain ones that I ordered  were like a semi sugary goodness in your mouth! Texture wise  it was slightly crunchy but was slightly burned too (which I don't think it was meant to be normally but I liked it) For $4.50 with the normal powedered sugar on top  I think of it as one big cookie that is actually good for you because you can taste a little bit of wheat in the mixture as well. Slightly expensive  but it was worth it.

Had never heard of them prior. Pictures looked great and who doesn't like waffles? Got the waffle with Fosselman's vanilla ice cream  chocolate syrup  and bananas. Warm sweet waffle with great ice cream. Damn it was good! So good I hit it up again before leaving.  If you've never had it  the waffle is already sweetened with sugar in the batter that gives it a nice carmelized flavor when cooked. Can't wait to have it again!

My family got 2 waffles - one topped with banana vanilla ice-cream and one topped with butter pecan. My little girl killed it... she couldn't stop eating. Both waffles were delicious. My one recommendation would be to eat the waffle as soon as you get it  since it's best warm. If you wait too long  the waffle gets cold and chewier than you might like. Still  it's great tasting and I can't wait to eat again.
_QNKVyihvoeCL8873l8x8Q,BSIiXUNL4GCFrGEiEE-AnA,2,4,8/12/2011,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,"After watching a segment on the Food Network about Wafels & Dinges food truck in New York  I was wondering how long it would take someone to start a waffle truck in LA. It has been a long wait  but finally there is a gourmet food truck serving up real Belgium Liege"" waffles in Southern California. Not only are they making killer fresh waffles but are also pairing it up with some great ice cream and toppings.  Lets start with the waffle. They make a traditional Belgium-style waffle called a Liege. The Liege waffle is made from dough so it tends to be a touch sweeter and chewier. This is not the waffle most restaurants serve in the U.S.  which are made from a batter and are called ""Brussels"" waffles. This is only my second time eating a Liege waffle but I really like the crunchy exterior and chewy interior texture of it.  Waffles de Liege offers a number of different toppings like Nutella  chocolate  caramel  whipped cream and fresh fruit like bananas and strawberries. You also have the option to top your waffle with Fosselman's Ice Cream. The ice cream is hand-made in LA and the truck carries several flavors at a time. There are no preservatives and it was extremely fresh.  I tried a couple of their waffles and ice cream combinations  a waffle with bananas  chocolate-covered strawberry ice cream dusted with powdered sugar and drizzled with chocolate syrup and one with fresh cut bananas  French Vanilla ice cream  powered sugar and Speculoos. We enjoyed the Speculoos the most. Speculoos is a spread that looks like peanut butter but tastes like a Belgian ""biscuit"" or cookie. That is because it is basically a gingerbread cookie turned into a spread. You have to try it. It is a great complement to the waffles.  I have a feeling Waffles de Liege is going to become very popular. Being new  they still have a few kinks to work out. Consistency was the only complaint I heard. One of the ones we tried from a friend was over cooked but the ice cream softened it up   so it was not a huge issue. The two we ordered were perfectly cooked so I am confident that they will straighten this out soon. I wonder if they would consider expanding their menu to include savory waffles in the future?"""
_QNKVyihvoeCL8873l8x8Q,78bNFcfYP8mvRefsjU73SQ,3,4,4/3/2011,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,I stopped by on my way home from dinner and picked up a waffle with chocolate sauce and a scoop of Fosselmans banana toffee ice cream.  Delicious!  When you first bite into one  the crispiness gives way to a caramelized sugar cake like consistency that holds up well even with the sauce and ice cream.  It is sweeter than a regular waffle  and you can taste the pearls of sugar.  They are great as a dessert  but I would even have one for breakfast with the fruit options which included strawberries and bananas.  Other toppings include caramel  white chocolate  nutella  as well as an assortment of Fosselmans ice cream flavors.        The dough is made fresh daily  and they also serve Jones coffee  which makes it even better that the ice-cream and coffee are both made locally.

I've been looking for Liege waffles for a while now and everywhere seems to only serve the Brussels waffles  or as Americans like to generalize it  Belgian Waffles."" When I first found out this place was going to open  I super excited and after trying it  I am uber satisfied! It makes me reminisce about my family's holiday in Belgium seven years ago walking around Grand Place with a waffle in-hand.  The pearl sugar in these waffles just crystallizes extremely nicely throughout. I've tried plain ones and ones with Speculoos (Belgian spread made from biscuit cookies). I had the pleasure to meet the owners & workers and they are EXTREMELY nice.  DELICIOUS WAFFLES & TREMENDOUSLY AWESOME WORKERS. I WILL BE BACK.  You should try this place out too.

Because of this waffle obsession  I had been wanting to try this truck for a while. I loved that you can pick out your toppings to make your own creation  and I decided to go with banana and caramel. Normally I'd be all over the Nutella rather than the caramel  but since it was so hot out when I visited this truck  the caramel sounded better.  There was a bit of line to order  but it moved quickly. A bit over $5 wasn't alarmingly expensive. After waiting for a few minutes for my waffle  my name was called  and I was a met by a worker with an attitude. I said  Yes for Nikki "" and he looked at me suspiciously and barked at me to hand over my number. Yikes! Food trucks are usually so friendly. I found the waffle to be very hard and overly sweet. I know that these are a different style waffle  but I just found it to be too crunchy. They not put many slices of banana on it either. Not a bad waffle  but not a great one either."""

I've only tried the waffles as is (without ice cream)  but next time i will definitely try that. They have Fosselman's Ice Cream from Fosselman's from Alhambra  California. The flavor of ice cream they have is some kind of bacon ice cream  which is a special type of ice cream just for them.  What i love about the waffle is the Belgian Pearl Sugar that is put in the waffles. Every bite you take  you can taste the sugar crystals breaking in your mouth  which makes the waffles so tasty.   The two owners  Lawrence and George are genuinely two down to earth guys. They're always friendly and very generous.  Friendly Owners + Awesome Waffles = highly recommended!

I came here during the Santa Anita Food Truck Fest and after eating tons  we wanted some sweets.  The waffle here is really awesome! They were crispy and just the right amount of sweetness. I assume the Belgian pearl sugar is what made the waffles so excellent. I got nutella/strawberries/and bananas with my waffle  and it was wonderful. There was a good denseness that made every bite very chewy. It was thick enough that it kind of broke my plastic fork.... I had to glue"" the little plastic fork tips to the nutella on the side of the plate hah!  My only gripe was the price.

I opted for a waffle with ice cream.  The ice cream is from Fosselman's (a very famous old-fashioned ice cream parlor near Pasadena).  The waffle was good.  It was not soggy but also not too crunchy or dry.  It had a good flavor.  I topped the waffle with caramel syrup and pistachio ice cream.  None of the toppings were great  but it was still a satisfying dessert.  I did not like my visit to Fosselman's that much (I thought the ice cream had too much butterfat and the flavors were not distinct)  but I thought the ice cream here was pretty decent.  Service was friendly and quick.  Prices were a little high for a good but not great dessert  but it was a very large portion (with the waffle and the large scoop of ice cream  it definitely felt like a dessert meant for sharing).  I am not a huge fan of food trucks  but I did think Waffles de Liege was pretty decent.  It is a good food truck if you are looking to share a sweet dessert with ice cream.

If it weren't for her  I would've passed up the GREATEST WAFFLE I HAVE EVER EATEN.  Liege waffles are belgian waffles that are made with chunks of sweet pearl sugar that caramelize as the batter cooks  forming a crispy outer layer. The waffle we ordered was smothered in nutella  strawberries  and Fosselman's banana heath ice cream (this was also my first time tasting Fosselman's ice cream - holy fuck). I could've done without the strawberries  but everything else blew my mind.  The waffle was incredible. The caramelized pearl sugar crackled in my mouth with every bite and sent my brain into a state of confused ecstasy. The nutella was a nice complement  but the Fosselman's ice cream was a star on its own. The next time I'm in Alhambra  I'm paying them a visit.

Maybe  it is because I am fairly systematic in doing my research before trying one or maybe it is just dumb luck. Either way  I will take it.  Now  I need to put something on the table  before last night  I had NEVER heard of this truck. So  I cannot really take credit for this one; it was purely dumb luck that they happened to show up at the Los Alamitos event. And  to tell you the truth  I wasn't much interested in trying their waffles. I tend to be more of a traditionalist when it comes to dessert  if it doesn't have chocolate  not dessert. In fact  I subscribe to the theory that apple pie is actually just fruit.  So  I really have my lovely wife to thank for this discovery  as she announced  Just so you know  we are getting a waffle "" after enjoying meals from The Lime and Flip Trucks. For some reason  I felt like being easy go (doesn't happen often) and I surrendered to her whim. Boy  am I glad I did.  I must say I was intrigue after quickly reading a few reviews in the cold and dark  desperately trying to make sure we selected the right dessert. And  we did. Holy Moly!  We went with the holiday special  which consists of THE best yummy waffle  amazing pumpkin ice cream and an excellent whipped cream finished with a powered cinnamon (I think). Now  I realize a few of you might be wondering  ""But Scott  this goes against your own dessert rule? Where is the chocolate?"" Like I said  I was feeling very easy going and went with the window's recommendation.  Now  usually any dessert without chocolate leaves me wanting a little more. This more than exceeded my expectations. The waffle was both crispy and gooey at the same time. The truck's special Belgian waffle recipe didn't disappoint. In fact  I was actually convinced that there was apple inside the waffle and even went and asked. The answer  ""No  dude...""  This thing was sooooo freakin' good that between my wife  me and the toddler  it was gone in a flash. It literally was one of the best desserts I have ever had  and I have had some pretty darn good treats around the world.

We were excited about trying Waffles de Liege but were a bit underwhelmed. First  the value is not there. The $4.50 they charge for a waffle a bit larger than your fist does'nt even include a topping. Now don't get me wrong...the waffle is delicious but I think it would be right if it included a topping or make the waffle a bit bigger. They charge .50 per topping ie: bananas  caramel syrup  strawberries. etc. They offer eclectic ice cream flavors that you can eat by itself or have one of their Waffle Ice Cream Sandwiches which I have to say looked Good.  Overall: I would try Waffles de Liege again with the hope they included a topping with their price or increase the size of the waffle.    Cash ONLY

When I heard a girl who was standing near the Waffles de Liege truck say the word speculoos I thought it was some awful racial slur. Seriously! I had never heard that word before in my life. After looking over the menu on the truck I found out it's a sweet spread they put on theirs waffles. After one bite I'll never be able to  forget that goofy word. Speculoos is DELICIOUS!   The Waffle de Liege truck is a dessert food truck dedicated to all things waffles. All their waffles are made in truck  which is cool.  Their menu is actually quite large. They have a few waffle combos you can choose from or you can get creative and make your own yummy waffle concoction.  My wife and I decided to create and split our own waffle. This is what we made;   Liege Waffle topped with crunchy speculoos spread  banana's  strawberries and Fosselman's vanilla bean ice cream   First off  major props to this truck for using Fosselman's ice cream and not some awful store brand.  Our waffle creation was fantastic. The waffle itself was light and fluffy. The bananas and strawberries were both perfectly ripe. Of course the ice cream was amazing but the star of this dessert was the speculoos. That spread tastes exactly like ground up graham crackers and ginger bread cookies. I like this spread almost as much as I like peanut butter...almost.   My only complaint is this truck is crazy pricey. Our creation set us back ten bucks  which is a crazy amount. They take credit cards though so that's a plus.   If you haven't tried Speculoos before hunt down this truck and get a waffle topped with buckets of the stuff. It's amazing!  Or you can do what I did immediately after I left the truck  which is go to Trader Joe's and buy a jar of their cookie butter (I Googled who sold the stuff). It's basically the same thing although they only have it in creamy  not crunchy. Boooo

Waffles de Liege really holds a winning waffle recipe. One of the things I despise the most about waffles is the lack of crispness of the exterior  but don't worry about that with Waffles de Liege  its cooked to perfection.   The imported Belgian pearl sugar that's incorporated into the waffle dough gives the exterior of the waffle that nice crispy golden caramelized texture while the interior holds a soft yet chewy consistency.   The waffle itself is not overly sweet which is why the spreads and syrup options accompanies really well with the waffle. If you want a bit of that refreshed feeling in your palate  than I'd suggest you add some fruit toppings as well.   Who can say no to ice cream? The truck carries Fosselman's ice cream (4 flavors change/rotate from time to time) so order a scoop of your desired ice cream on top of your waffle to get the delectable combination's of warm  crispy  chewy  cool  and refreshing taste all throughout your mouth.   Move over Syrup Desserts and all other waffle makers  there's a new competitor in town!

The liege waffle was hard... which we attributed to the pearl sugar in their batter. But the inside wasn't soft  either. It wasn't dough-ey... it had the texture of 3 day old bread that's been left out on the counter. My guess is it wasn't freshly made or there's a problem with the batter.

This keeps the waffles fresh and the service fast. They seemed stressed.  When we finally made it up front we ordered one waffle with coffee ice cream on top  caramel and whipped cream. Sounds like a winning combination to me. We waited about ten more minutes and we walked away waffle in hand; tired but very excited.  The waffle batter is sweeter than any waffle I have ever tasted. It's very good  especially in dessert form. Our was burnt on the bottom which was very disappointing and odd. When you are trying to make a product fast one anticipates it being a little under cooked. This burning meant that we could have had a better waffle faster. Sad.  Fosselman's is one of the best ice creams I have ever had and their coffee ice cream on top was no different. It was creamy  coffee joy in ice cream form. Add the caramel and whipped cream and you have the makings for a perfect evening.   Next time I would like to try them when they are a little less frazzled. If we had been in and out in a reasonable amount of time with a non burnt waffle in hand this may have been a 5 star review.
_QNKVyihvoeCL8873l8x8Q,hzb3V3Za_A5IqnvegRff7A,1,2,7/17/2011,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,So disappointed...   Tried this truck at the Eat Real Festival this weekend with fellow yelper Sharon L. It looked delicious and seemed so appetizing. We ordered their signature waffle with strawberry ice cream with chocolate bits inside and chocolate and caramel drizzle.   It looked so yummy  but first bite and... Meh. It tasted as if the waffle had been left out for way too long to the point that the dough was stale. Given how quickly the food came out  it clearly wasn't freshly made. It was too hard and too chewy and it didn't have that crunchy and soft texture that good waffles have.   For $5... we got half of a very small terribly tasting waffle and a small scoop of strawberry chocolate chip ice cream.    No Thanks.

We are from out-of-town so we took a special trip up to SLO to check out restaurants to hold the rehearsal dinner at. We visited several restaurants that day. When we came to Blue  they were actually closed. We didn't realize it until we tugged on the door and found that it was locked. As we were walking away  Eric  owner and chef  opened the door and graciously invited us in. He showed us around  talked about their menu and answered all of our questions. We came away with a great first impression. I called Patricia  owner and wife of Eric  and she promptly returned my call and answered all of my questions. My husband and I ventured up to SLO one more time and had dinner at Blue. The food was superb and the service was impeccable! That was it! We knew this was the place to have the rehearsal dinner!!   Patricia worked with us on the planning of the menu and other details of the evening. A special menu was printed with our son and daughter-in-law's name on it  along with all of the wonderful selections for the evening. They even allowed us to come early and put our personal touch on the decor  up in the loft  which by itself was already inviting!  Needless to say  the evening was a huge success! Our guests loved the atmosphere  raved about the food  enjoyed the wine  and appreciated the attentive service! Please  if you are considering a place to have a meaningful gathering  go to Blue! It's worth every penny!   Thank you Eric  Patricia and staff for making our evening one to remember! We'll be back!

I didn't read the yelp reviews before coming here and ended up bringing my baby to dinner when visiting the area.  The staff was very accommodating with the stroller.  But I felt kind of bad for ruining the ambiance of the other diners.   Thankfully it wasn't too crowded and the baby was mellow throughout the dinner.  Oysters: Fantastic!  We got a selection of oysters from different regions.  All were fresh and incredibly tasty.  Herb Roasted Halibut: Perfectly prepared!  The fish was light and well seasoned.  The accompanying ravioli was al dente.  Divine!  For dessert - go for the dark chocolate fondue.  It was served with fresh fruit  moist pound cake and crunchy almonds.  Fantastic!  I'd return again if in the area.

The apps were excellent  which is why the second star came into play / ahi  cheese plate were the best.  They did forget about our other 2 but that tied to the service end of it.  Meals were good  the steak special isn't what we thought but the other 2 which were the lamb and the fish special were high in flavor.  The service on the other hand was very poor.  We brought two bottles of wine with us to celebrate the evening and waited 15 minutes for the first to get opened after we had to ask.  From then on  we were literally on our own.  We poured every last sip ourselves  not out of desire but out of necessity.  The waitress seemed very into her friend who was sitting at the end of the room  that by itself isn't the end of the world but not what we expected from such a highly reviewed restaurant and also considering the price.  Very good food  cool atmosphere  poor service.

No frozen butts on the sidewalk for this girl  a warm bar stool and a glass of wine is how I take in my parades.   Eric and Patricia Korbel own and run this well-oiled machine and I crown Eric as one of the best and most consistent chefs anywhere.  One of the capping achievements of the Korbel's is their unparalleled wait staff.  They are all well trained  attentive and make each meal feel like a celebration.  This evening we were lucky enough to get Nicole  a gorgeous girl with a personality and table presence that is unsurpassed.   We started with Spicy Lentil Soup with cr\u00e8me frach\u00e8 that had the heat and protein needed to shake the cold off your bones.  This chef's revelation was perfect for the evening and tasted even better sopped up with fresh Provencal bread from Farb's Bakery.  The bread with a sprig of rosemary on the softened butter is one of the reasons I visit Korbel at Blue.   Our next treat was the Seared Foie Gras of Duckseasoned with fleur de sel de gu\u00e9rande  served with huckleberry waffle  tiny caramelized onion  and a ginger scented port wine reduction.  I thought the waffle was going to be weird  but it brought out the flavor of the liver and balanced it with sweetness.  This dish was so rich and amazing  I could of eaten four more.   We shared the Hoisin Marinated Chicken Lettuce Wrap; with several fresh butter lettuce leafs that are used as a taco that you stuff with chicken.  This is one of my favorite appetizers and I order it every time I dine at Blue  you should try it  the mixture of spicy meat  salty peanuts  and the buttery lettuce are a symphony of flavors.   As we watched the marching bands  gymnastics teams  and preschools march down the street we ordered six raw oysters.  Two each from Washington  New York and Maine that were freshly shucked and iced  served with red chili mignonette sauce and a horseradish/tomato sauce  these delicate creatures were so fresh  the barnacles on the shell were still alive.   Instead of dessert  we ordered a Potato Onion Pierogi with smoked sturgeon  and sturgeon caviar.  A dap of sour cream in the middle  topped with amazing display of culinary genius off and made our palates sing along with the Christmas carols.

The soft shell crab appetizer sat too long before being served so it was limp.  The rib eye steak was very good  the lamb  not so.  The wine selection was good and the risotto was al dente.  It was  however  my husbands birthday and we were seated in the enchanted grotto (facetious) upstairs which I guess is for the less desirable guests.  Dark depressing space which reeks of the kitchen.  Wonderful menu  wonderful service but I would go where every guest is treated as well as the other.

The noise level is moderate for a bar/restaurant  and it's an impressive  convivial place for a date. If your date goes awry  it's not because of the food or atmosphere here.

I just wanted to grab a cocktail with my girls before we went to dinner for my friends bday. I wish the website had a full list of cocktails because i dont see what we ordered and it was amazing. My friend had something with drizzled honey that was so good i was tempted to drink it while she was in the bathroom. mine had a flower (elderflower?) in it which was great.   I also had to give in and order the foie gras with the waffle. I never saw that combo before but with the sauce it was PERFECTION. Saddest day coming up when they will outlaw this in California so glad to have gotten some in before that day comes.   Bartender was super sweet & helpful with the menu which is not always the case at cocktail bars.   Will definitely come back here for my next road trip into SLO.

We have been here twice so far  once being on New Years Eve and we got stellar service with a packed house. Reservations recommended for holidays or peak times  the owner even called me to confirm my new years reservation.The food has been worth the money- delicious and with surprisingly huge portions. For our new years meal I got the duck (that I sadly couldn't even finish it was so large)  he got the ribeye  we shared the caesar salad and I had a glass of wine and the bill came to about $100 including the tip. Our second trip was on a Tuesday and it was a much better atmosphere without so many people. When the restaurant is full  the tables are a little bit too close together to have a very romantic dinner. He again got the ribeye and I tried the seared ahi which was delicious! They pass the water glass test- our glasses were never empty throughout dinner. Definitely worth going for a nice date night or celebratory meal.

The ONLY great martini in San Luis Obispo.  Still five stars for me.  Regarding the complaints of certain reviewers that it is overpriced.  I can only say that SLO prices compete with San Francisco prices and we know the rent is higher in SF  and they also have to pay for health care for their workers.  Given all that  I think that Blue is definitely worth the price.  It is hands down the very best restaurant in san Luis Obispo.

The service is beautiful in appearance and performance but the food is sooooooo NOT worth the price. It's a lot of words for bland food. It's not that the food is bad  it's just not near worth what they're charging. So have a drink  enjoy the beautiful ambiance but eat somewhere else.

It is located inside a restored 1930's building and the inside is very modern and sleek.  We started at the bar and order an Old Fashioned which turned into two.  Finding a good Old Fashioned is hard to come by but the bartender here did not disappoint.  We then were seated upstairs in a nice small exclusive corner overlooking the lower level.  We started off with oysters and the Potato Onion Pierogi appetizer  but of which were fantastic.  I went with the Snake River Farms New York Steak and the Caesar Salad.  The salad was topped with fresh anchovies and tasted like what a Caesar Salad should taste like.  The steak was cooked to perfection and made with a Cabernet reduction with a side of Maytag Blue Butter.   It was one of the best steaks I've had in a while.  The service was excellent and they kept the wine flowing.  There are some great dining choices in SLO  but this one is definitely one to add to the list.
_UyjMqhiaP1n9WC5Xt3Ngw,fJzc6RhAc3BEEcj-iX0bhQ,1,4,5/26/2010,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,The Good: The Bar  The Desserts (cobbler  chocolate souffle) Atmosphere  Service.  The Bad: Weird smell at the bar (something with the wood?) Gets really busy and loud.  I'm only giving four stars because I didn't have dinner  so this isn't a full review. Anyway  4 stars for dessert and drinks. Came here on a Thursday when Farmers was in full swing. This may have been a bad choice because it was extremely busy  but my experience really didn't suffer. Right when we walked into the bar someone approached us. There was no waiting to see if we should seat ourselves or what  we were promptly helped and made space for at the bar. Looking at the drinks for only about 2 minutes the bartender asks us what we would like. Telling her I would like dessert she brings me the dessert list. The list is not extensive but the choices all sounded amazing. Decided on the mixed berry cobbler  with creme fraise ice cream. YUM. I split it and when I took the first bite I realized you don't split dessert here. After fighting over the last bite  we enjoyed our cocktails. He had a manhattan  I had some wine. The drink list was ridiculous. You could come here for a year straight and still not have tried everything. They have this absinthe machine.. looked daunting. Wine  drink  dessert came out to be like $30  tip included. Not bad for a nice time. Next I need to try dinner. If anything on the menu is as good as that dessert it will be a sure winner.
_UyjMqhiaP1n9WC5Xt3Ngw,1sMUcEf8Q1xghMPeYTVzqQ,1,3,6/25/2010,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,Blue has food that tastes good and keeps a pretty high level of sophistication  but always manages to feel overpriced.   Order the specials  as in my experience  they seem to outshine the menu's staples. I've enjoyed venison medallions and veal liver (this was killer  I must say) from the 'specials' list but have also had dry halibut and overly-salted fois gras from the standard menu.  The wine list leaves something to be desired. It's stocked with brands that were pretty good five years ago but lacks any coverage of emerging Central Coast stars. The liquor options are quite sufficient  however.  Atmosphere is private or social (restaurant and bar seating) and the service is pretty good.  Still  I could have food that completely outshines Koberl's for 2/3 the price in any major city.

It was busy the friday night we came here  but the hostess was really nice and we waited around for a table.   Tried a dirty martini and manhattan  both made very well and nice and cold. I think they were about $12 each - so not cheap - but they were pretty big. I love the location and the cool brick walls. Also the service in the bar was great. They didn't rush our group of four nor did we feel ignored.

We tried a lot of the specials for the evening and felt they were better than the regular menu items.

The bar can get really packed on the weekends so be prepared to stalk around a bit for a table  but it will be well worth the effort.

As a matter of fact  when we start with the drinks  it is hard to work our way over to the restaurant since the drinks and the appetizers are so good.  BEST Martinis in town  and best mixed drinks...and they will accommodate weird requests and special instructions with ease and good humor.   Also best quality appetizers and small plates  with portions large enough to make a meal.  We love to get a table  get a drink tab going  and order from the appetizer menu.  Great foie gras with a crispy waffle in an actual reduction sauce  or tempura  crisp light calimari  or a half dozen oysters raw  followed by a half dozen oysters baked a la Rockefeller  succulent and delicious.  The bar scene is also about the only place in town for professionals  and not totally populated with students. The salmon is my favorite entree  but my carnivorous buddies have devoured the rack of lamb  the filet  and the pork chops  all with happy faces.  You can choose your wine from a separate wine list  with enough reds and whites to please anyone. The bananas foster were so good we practically licked the plate  and I have fond memories of the tarte tatin from another occasion  and large enough potions to share. The sophisticated atmosphere in a turn of the century brick builidng with stained glass windows and tin ceiling give Blue the right historic  touch to add to an evening of elegant dining.
_UyjMqhiaP1n9WC5Xt3Ngw,#NAME?,1,4,11/15/2010,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,What's not to like. This place oozes class. The venue itself is a great balance of exposed brick walls with just the right amount of exposed wood trim lightly decorated. The tin ceiling is a darker color so it blends right in with the rest of the d\u00e9cor. The building is pretty old and is part of the original SLO Downtown core giving it all kinds of character. The crowd can be fairly divers but always friendly. If you arrive before 9pm there is a good chance you can find an open spot in the bar area. The bartenders know their craft and you can rest assured that whatever you order will be poured or mixed correctly. The service is among the best in SLO with a strong consistency. On our last visit my friends (one visiting SLO for the first time) were so impressed how even our waters were refilled constantly during a busy time (Don't forget to tip well).    This is my fianc\u00e9e's favorite bar in San Luis Obispo.  The place has changed a bit over the years but I have been living in the LA area since I graduated from Cal poly in 2006 so I can't comment on the more recent changes to entertainment and music. When I attended Cal Poly they use to have live music and DJ's playing after 10pm but not sure if they still do this. I think some live Jazz would really hit the spot.   We have not had a full sit down meal here but we have tried pretty much every appetizer and it is hard to go wrong. The food I have seen served to other patrons looks delicious. We plan to do a full meal next time we are in San Luis Obispo but for the time being this review is about the bar and the appetizers.   On this visit we enjoyed their Gruyere Onion & Prosciutto Tart and Cheese Plate. The tart was well balanced and played out each of the ingredients without one overpowering the other (Perfect wine food). We found the cheese plate to be our favorite (3 cheese house selection)  particularly the La-Tur Italian cheese a creamy and buttery blend of Goat  Sheep  and Cow. The cheese platter had all the elements for pairing with wine and other spirits. The honey glaze paired will with several of the cheeses and the pear slices.   We had drinks ranging between wine and Calvados French Apple Brandy. Wine selection is wonderful and they have a $20 corkage fee. My friend was impressed they had Calvados French Apple Brandy as he has only seen it at a handful of places in California  always super classy places. My other friend loved the scotch selection and pricing (Almost a $1 per year  making it a great value). Being from LA the drink pricing seemed very fair  they only carry quality stuff.   If you are looking for a classy joint to enjoy great wine food and the perfect drinks to go with your food  this place will not disappoint you. Also don't forget the blue cheese stuffed olives  you can asked for a couple on the side  my fianc\u00e9e is in love with them. I don't even like olives but I enjoyed them the couple of times I've had them with my martini. Like I said earlier  the only improvement I would suggest is some live Jazz (This may already be happening  but not the Saturday night I was there).

My friend and I split some small plates even though the dinners looked amazing. The seared sea scallops with edamame puree was delish as was the beef carpaccio. I loved the asian chicken lettuce wraps  but the goat cheese and beet salad will not be ordered again by either of us...way too much beet & almost no salad to that dish. I will say it is a gorgeous restaurant with attentive  friendly & knowledgeable staff. We enjoyed the quiet ambiance at a relaxed pace  I do love a restaurant that does not make you feel as though your table is needed and you should be eating faster. My friend enjoyed an after dinner coffee to go along with our dark chocolate fondue and we left after 90 minutes feeling relaxed with well filled tummies!

I committed alcohol blasphemy and ordered non-coastal wines because I was scouting half-bottles but the overall wine  beer  and cocktail list is impressive. If nothing else come here for a drink and the oysters which were hands down the best I've ever had. I would have preferred warm bread but it was tasty nonetheless. The pork and NY strip were cooked perfectly although I could have done without the cabernet reduction on my beef - I'm more of a purist when it comes to steak. Finished off the meal by inhaling the bananas foster napoleon while enjoying an alcohol laden coffee. The service was prompt  ambiance was OK but a bit too crowded for my taste - you will hear other tables conversations so not the most intimate romantic spot. I'm more inclined to go back to visit the bar but wouldn't hesitate to order a full meal if the mood strikes.   peace  love  and good booze ~ chase http://goodbooze.tumblr.com/post/5950447011

It's a place to hang out with friends  take the parents or graduating student out to dinner  or have a nice date. Great bar area with a full bar  good drinks  wine and beer selections and great tapas; and just around the wall is the restaurant  great for groups or quiet dates. The two areas manage to coexist without seeming attached.  The whole place exudes class and ambiance and yet there is no dress code or discrimination against clientele  some places just inspire people to act normal and at the same time repel those who would tend not to  and this is one of those rare spots. And by the way the normal clientele is 25-40 year old professionals.  Food is very tasty with good variety and excellent deserts to accompany  just expect to pay for the quality you get

I have eaten here 3 or 4 times now and have been blown away every time. Everything my friends and I have ever tried has been delicious. We have not been disappointed whether it be an appetizer  main course  or dessert.  The atmosphere is swanky  sophisticated  yet always friendly and not pretentious. We tend to eat dinner late and have never been hurried even as the last diners left.  I disagree that it is overpriced."" It is a more upscale dining experience but definitely on par with other restaurants of this caliber in terms of pricing. The only difference is that Blue has better tasting food.   I'm vegetarian and they have an entirely separate vegetarian menu!!! That made me love the place instantaneously as most fine dining restaurants don't care about vegetarians. Order the fresh sauteed vegetables. It comes with a perfectly cooked assortment of unique fresh vegetables in the most divine  creamy  white wine sauce you'll ever taste. It doesn't sound like anything special (just veggies) but it is a complete and delicious meal. They happened to be serving a butternut squash risotto side dish one night that I ordered separately but complimented it perfectly.  My fiance orders the gruyere tart appetizer pretty much every time. He had the halibut the first AND second time he was here because it was so good.   The food is always made with the freshest ingredients  locally grown whenever possible. It is always brilliantly flavored  spiced  and sauced...never bland. And they have a very diverse menu. You will not be disappointed if you decide to treat yourself for a night!"""

Sure  the portions are the same (i.e. HUGE) but I feel like the veggies aren't as fresh whenever I go.  Maybe I'm just unlucky?  Also  I think they might have changed the recipe for my favorite dressing (Herbal Vinaigrette).  Not sure what it is  but something doesn't taste the same.  It's still a cozy place to eat but it gets pretty crowded  so I usually take it to go.  This place isn't the cleanest joint in Berkeley so if that bothers you  I'd go to Smart Alec's for your salad fix.  Personally  it's not a problem.  I still go back every once in a while when I'm jonesing for some greens (the legal  nutritious kind)  but I've been disappointed the last few times.  Still  I haven't completely given up on this place.

Fortunately at 5pm there was no line  so up I went and ordered. Love love love their honey wheat bread. Their salad  even in the to-go box was huge that we had a hard time finishing it. Love the poppyseed dressing and their sliver of a pineapple. I also ordered their eggplant sandwich  and it still tasted good after driving back home to SF.  Cash only  but prices are so reasonable  you shouldn't have any problems.

Protip: Order salad ""for here""  dressing on the side so it doesnt get mushy regardless of where you are eating.  After I've eaten a full meal from the ""for here"" salad  I can still fill a to-go box up.    Can be very crowded at lunch time  but if you're willing to wait a seat usually opens up."""

And this is coming from a person who can eat a 16 oz rib eye and finish off 12 more ounces of steak!  I have to admit  that I was a bit skeptical that I would like a sandwich/salad spot  but I do.  The one salad fed me and my husband and we split a sandwich  too.  I think the key is that the veggies are fresh.  The price is good and I have to admit that being in Berkeley  I wanted to be healthy.""  So this was a natural place to go to.  If my daughter ever decides to go to school here  I'm so for it so I can eat the fresh salads and sandwiches!  Oh and it would help if she gets a full ride scholarship."""
_VVitWVj4AvzqV91O6c1Mw,OKe-uQrYHS9_gmLWgIpgRA,3,5,2/19/2010,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,My 1st 5 stars since 2008!  This is my favorite Sandwich/Salad shop on this side of the Bay or actually... the entire Bay Area.   Great prices  large portions  delicious bread on the side of the salads. Their most popular  and in my opinion  best dressing is the poppyseed dressing. During lunch hours its pretty hard to find seating. You order in a way that reminds me of a school cafeteria line and you clean up after yourself (or you could leave it for the bus boys to come around... eventually. But you can't really because sometimes they're so packed that people are standing around waiting for a seat).   If i had to pick between the sandwiches or salads.. I'd go with salad just cause it's that good.  It's always so fresh  love the ingredient options  and I never leave feeling guilty. I always walk out feeling fulfilled and healthy. Best salads ever!! mmm bean sprouts and cherry tomatoes... I want to get one now but too bad it's traffic hour across the bridge.

They give you a ton of meat in each sandwich  and they use a delicious honey wheat bread with it. You can also request their specialty breads if you would like.   I always order their chef salad  which is their most complicated salad. It includes sandwich meat of your choice  cherry tomatoes  croutons  avocado  a sliced boiled egg  kidney beans  garbanzo beans  and alfalfa sprouts. I order it with the poppy seed dressing and with deli turkey. Be warned though -- this salad is HUGE. The only way I can finish it is if I share it with a friend.  I also order their sandwiches  and my favorite is their chicken salad sandwich. It has a great texture and has a lot of flavor.  The restaurant has a rustic and Berkeley"" feel -- meaning it is really comfortable and great for students. Lunchtime can get really crowded  so you may have to wait for a group to leave in order to take their table."""

Some people say it's changed and I do think they skimp on the meat now (although they still give you a lot in your sandwiches...it just used to be even more than that) and use grape tomatoes instead of sliced roma tomatoes  it's still the same ol' place that has delicious salads and sandwiches.    I love love LOVE the honey wheat bread.  I can eat that all day long.  I heard before  you could get a bag full of the bread ends for a quarter or so  but I'm not sure if they still do that.  I usually get the BLTA  which is a BLT with AVOCADO.  The bacon is always crispy and never oily  which is amazing considering they make the sandwich as I'm walking through the line.  The salads are huge so get the dressing on the side (poppy seed is great) so you can save some of the salad for later.  They sometimes skimp on the salad but most of the time  they fill the bowl or plastic to go container up to the brim with spring mix  sprouts  cucumbers  tomatoes and croutons!  I love how it also comes with a slice of pineapple sometimes  which is a perfect way to end the meal.    There is usually a very long line  but it moves quickly.  The workers are a bit unfriendly sometimes  in both their appearance and attitude.  However  the food is always good and they move through the line quickly so I don't want to complain.  The main downside for me is that it only takes cash.
_VVitWVj4AvzqV91O6c1Mw,zVv9SeWJZLDpqMghrq0feQ,2,4,5/2/2010,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,okay  so im not sure if its called intermezzo or mattina these days but here is what i know...  -gigantic salads (although the gigantic-ness varies on the day/time that you go); id recommend eating here (as opposed to getting it to go) b/c the portions are bigger and you can easily share it with another person (cheap meal!)  -fresh produce (again  it depends on the day/time that you go  though  because ive gotten brown lettuce and smooshy tomatoes before)  -cash only; $6.75 for a salad or $7 for half salad/half sandwich  -vegetarian delight salad comes with 1 hard boiled egg  croutons  1/2 avocado  carrots  cabbage  tomatoes  a few cucumber slices and a hunk of honey wheat bread on the side. sometimes you get a slice of fruit  sometimes you dont  -most importantly  and this is a big negative for me  the employees do NOT change their gloves after handling meat
_VVitWVj4AvzqV91O6c1Mw,lkVF5wXt4bdJQg29ms09dw,1,5,7/14/2010,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,I am not a salad person. quite the opposite actually. i like my meat. fried  dipped in oil  lathered in grease...but if there were a place that would make me a vegetarian  or at least start to eat healthier  it would be this place.   they give you a lot of food. seriously. i have the metabolism of an olympic triathlete and the appetite of a horse  but their servings will fill you up. both their chef's salads and sandwiches are made for a king. everything is made in front of you.   the place is small  but very homey. the inside feels like you're outside on a french/italian (take your pick) sidewalk. but decorated like its a hip/modern rooftop backyard. i know what i just wrote does not make sense but trust me  this place rocks.

It's a wonderful place to eat at with your friends because the atmosphere is warm and welcoming. Your food is made right on the spot and prepared pretty quickly. I've tried their salads with poppyseed dressing (which is what they're known for  apparently) and the salad was HUGE! The sandwiches on wheat bread are delicious!! I've never had such tasty wheat bread. It's thick and soft. The other time I share a Chef Salad and we were both very very very very very full. The veggie tastes fresh too!

GET THE SALAD!! plus  the salad comes with a huge chunk of their store-made honey wheat bread and pineapple  yum.  also  try their strawberry lemonade. its amazingly tasty!  P.S. this place is always buzzing and is pretty busy when lunch time rolls around  don't be intimidated! the line moves fast! as for eating your salad.. you might have to get it to-go or just keep an eye out for an open seat the first thing you get in the door.
_VVitWVj4AvzqV91O6c1Mw,E-x7cWEI29SgaxoAnZD8GA,1,5,3/7/2010,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,So a few months ago I came home to find a note posted to my door stating that Hearst (my street) would be closed off next week for the filming of a scene for Parenthood  the new cross-generational NBC dramedy appealing to adults aged 23-57.....set in Berkeley.  The location of the scene in question was Oscar's  which was puzzling to me  because I think Mattina (formerly Intermezzo) is more emblematic of Berkeley.    Giant fresh salads  succulent honey wheat bread  a giant indoor tree  great music selection  located on telegraph....if I had to pick one place to eat daily in Berkeley  it would be here.  Does Ron Howard read Yelp?  ps if you get the dressing on the side  its easy to amortize that salad over lunch and dinner.

No less an authority than Weekly food critic Jonathan Gold claimed this was some of the finest Okonomiyaki in LA  so when the truck was in my area  I had to pay a visit.  What is Okonomiyaki? I lived in Japan for 6 months many years ago and never came across it. Basically it is a savory pancake or griddle cake often made for festive occasions. People sometimes refer to it as Japanese pizza because of the general flat shape and because you can select a wide variety of ingredients to go in and on your Okonomiyaki.  Basically  you first choose an essential meat ingredient. I'm told that shrimp and pork are the traditional choices  but I also had the salmon  which was very good. The shrimp was still better. For accents  I usually go with more Asian ingredients like scallions  ginger  kimchi  and bonito flakes. You can also get more creative and go with options like bacon and provolone. A Japanese mayo and special soy-based sauce are drizzled on top.  The end result is a good-sized tasty meal. Definitely a good value for the money and you won't find something of this quality anywhere else.  They also have Teppan-yaki skewers with rice and salad  which are also available in half orders (and are still pretty big).  The staff are friendly and helpful  the truck is clean and the kitchen professionally run. Your food is served in a high-quality reusable plastic container (complete with a fortune"" on the personalized label). Everything about this truck says quality.   The only negative is that because each order is custom-made  the wait time can be a little long. But well worth it."""

I can't believe the other reviews don't mention how rich and heavy the okonomiyaki is  it might have been 4 stars if I was crudo and ate it in recovery mode but for lunch it didn't hit the spot. I'll give them another chance but won't be ordering the okonomiyaki next time.
_xREqE5m3o3zGjy4xVZnlQ,awXWTzaFJjON4ePkqtYNbg,4,5,7/19/2011,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,OMG my okonomiyaki was amazing. I ordered the shrimp and bacon okonomiyaki with bonito flakes on top. This tasted just like the okonomiyaki I had when I lived in Japan for a few months. The portions are huge  the sauce and mayo combo is yummy and the people working the truck were really nice. I will be visiting this truck often to have more okonomiyaki and to try the other dishes as well.

I have tried it twice now  first I had the okonomiyaki with chicken and beef  everything about this is so delicious. The special sauce on top is so good. The second time I tried the chicken teppanyaki with miso plum sauce  apple-ginger mix salad and rice pilaf  so yummy! Their portions are large  the packaging is great and its reusable which makes it easy to take what you didn't finish and save it for another great meal later. The staff is super friendly and very helpful with recommendations! I highly recommend their food and can't wait to try it again!

As hard as I tried  I just couldn't come up with a Haiku for how delicious and great this food truck is.   Glow fish is not your typical Japanese food truck. You've already accepted the fact that you can get good sushi off the side of the truck with Fish Lips and the other sushi joints. Glow fish on the other hand explores some Japanese deliciousness in the form of griddle cakes.   I'm not white so I don't typically crave mayo  but for some reason tasting the mayo laced on this Okonomiyaki made me crave more of it like a vampire in a blood bank. Now you may be confused on what a bespoken essential is  but don't worry  it's just the protein that you're going to have with this griddle cake.   It's original.. well  I guess not really original if you're from the land of the rising sun. Then this would just be considered a typical meal. Much like how in China they don't call it Chinese food.  But you get my point that this is fairly original for the sake of getting something like this off the side of a food truck. No matter how fusion crazy the trucks are getting these days  this is still something to be tried and enjoyed at all cost.   Something new and well worth the lack of wait time you'll face with their excellent and zen like service.
